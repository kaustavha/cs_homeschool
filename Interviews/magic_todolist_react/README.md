# Interview introduction

The goal is to build a todo list with the following features:  

- ability to add items
- ability to recursively add sub-items to items to an infinite depth
- ability to remove/complete items
- items underneath parent item should also be cleared if parent is cleared
- persist state, at least in the front-end via a mock users systems so that:
  - users can "login"
  - make a todo list
  - logout
  - log back in
  - see the same list

Time limit: 2hrs

## My solutions
- Use create react app to scaffold a quick working environment for this - todo lists are common in front end tutorials
- Iteratively build out a solution from base building blocks
- In my case I came to a todoItem as the base, outwards from that, creating and deleting it
- create => TodoInput component
- delete => doneButton component
- Recursively linking the todoItem and todoInput to allow creation of child todo items at every level via props
- Creating a userNameInput component to render the top level todoInput after 'login'
- Lifting state from todo list components into users handling component to allow persistence past logout 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
