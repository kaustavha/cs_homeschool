I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with frontend, go, react and noticed them in the post.
I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM. I also recieved a scholarship from the EF to attend Devcon IV this year.
I'm a big proponent of open source with commits made and merged into 10+ projects including Pythons pip & FBs HHVM PHP compiler

I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM. I also recieved a scholarship from the EF to attend Devcon IV this year.

I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM. I also recieved a scholarship from the EF to attend Devcon IV this year.

I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with java, kubernetes, devops, mobile, web, javascript, react, node, hadoop, hive, kafka, python and noticed them in the post.
I'm a big proponent of open source with commits made and merged into 10+ projects including Pythons pip & FBs HHVM PHP compiler
Here's my resume: <a href='http://kaustavha.github.io/kaustav-haldar-resume/'>bit.ly/khaldarcv</a> 
          LinkedIn: <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaldar'>khaldar</a> 
          Github: <a href='https://github.com/kaustavha'>kaustavha</a> 

Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit for anything you're looking for. 
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Thanks, 
Kaustav Haldar
