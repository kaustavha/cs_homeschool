Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:

- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

I’d specifically like to work with someone on Fullstack Go and Fullstack Rust - which is less about the respective languages and more like guides to building full-stack web applications with each, including third-party libraries, etc. But we’re also looking to write content about Python, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
(I've talked more about our economics of writing books here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17015117)

Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Xamarin developer: C# experience as a minimum, F# desirable (we can also mentor you on the transition from C# to F#), interested/knowledgeable in Rust is another plus.

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or zkSNARKs.

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 6months.

Varonis (www.varonis.com) | New York, NY | Marketing Demand Gen | Full-Time | Remote
Varonis is an enterprise software company (B2B) that helps organizations better secure their data.

This is perhaps not the most glitzy thing, but I really appreciate that:

- The software does what it says

- It's pretty unique in how it does it

- Actually, genuinely useful to the people that use it daily

- Helps protect basically everybody else on the internet

In short, it's something I feel really good about representing and I think that makes marketing it much easier.

The Inbound group is fully remote, large enough to have an actual budget for things, small enough to have some flexibility in execution and be open to new ideas.

We're looking for a very hands-on person who can help increase the number of inbound leads generated by leveraging the work of the existing content and sales teams. We want to build intelligent multi-step campaigns that educate and inform prospects as the first introduction to our company, explore new campaign platforms and make smart data-driven decisions about what to pursue.

I realize marketing jobs aren't usually what gets posted here, but the people who have really thrived at Varonis are both really technical (a third of the marketing team are full stack devs who moved into marketing, myself included) and adept at marketing. Our biggest wins have been when we've been able to cross those two disciplines in a unique way.

If you're interested, please use the 'Apply' button on the job page here (which also has some more details about the role)

BBOXX | Software Engineer | London | Onsite
BBOXX provides affordable energy to off grid customers in sub-Saharan Africa using an innovative IOT based solar kit combined with cashless digital payments. We are looking for experienced developers to maintain and break our back-office solution into focused micro services.
Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071

About BBOXX

Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.

BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable solar energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 solar systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.

Stile Education | Software Engineers | Melbourne, Australia | ONSITE Full-time
Stile’s mission is to improve scientific literacy among young people around the world - that is, their ability to engage, reflect and think critically about how the world works. We are a team of outstanding teachers, scientists, engineers and business professionals who come together every day to create science education resources that kids actually want to engage with.

We’re looking for another backend engineer to join our team, building features our users will love and scaling the product to meet the demand from our rapidly growing user base. You’ll work mainly on our service-oriented Ruby applications running on AWS, as well as on the full tech stack that supports them.

You either have a CS/engineering degree, or you've taught yourself the bits that matter. You might have worked with some databases before and learned your B-trees from your hash tables and what a row-level lock is. You've not only built a few CRUD APIs, but you've probably also untangled a few race conditions, and you now think through failure states and idempotency whenever you write new code.

You'll end up working with Ruby, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker (we use it for just about everything), AWS, Protocol Buffers, Prometheus (we’re big on monitoring our app and keeping ahead of problems!), and whatever tools you choose to solve the problem at hand. Haven't used many of these before? That's fine; this is a great opportunity to learn!

Hinge Health | San Francisco | ONSITE | Senior Mobile UI Engineer
We've got an exciting opportunity available for someone who's been itching to work on a production-grade React Native mobile application. This job is for you if:

- you think TypeScript is a leap forward and can't wait to use it in a professional context (no prior experience necessary!).

- React makes you look back on imperative UI programming as the "dark ages".

- despite all the above, you'd feel 100% comfortable writing a light web app in Vanilla JS.

- you love the idea of directly helping people, rather than mining them for data.

- compromising on user experience, letting users do the QA work, or other similar abuses of users' trust does not fly in your book.

This is not at all an entry level position, and our standard for a Senior Engineer title may be higher than what many people are used to. We'll be particularly looking for a track record of building user interfaces in a professional context – code samples and live demos are a big plus.

Email me directly with "Hello from HN" in the subject line to hear more about the position and to apply formally.

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; now also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent in the following roles:


  * [Senior] Front-end Engineer - React; London & LA
  * Data Engineer; London
  * Quantitative Developer; London
  * Low-Latency C++ Engineer; London

E-commerce Venture [Stealth Mode] | On-site at our Santa Monica, Los Angeles office
We are reimagining the e-commerce paradigm. Help us build a new platform to connect buyers with trusted sellers and improve the online-shopping experience.
We’re hiring senior front/back-end engineers and product designers. You should be a self-starter; the ideal candidate is comfortable wearing many hats in a fast-paced, startup environment. We’re building a next generation e-commerce platform, so prior experience in the e-commerce domain or a startup is a plus.

This is an exciting opportunity to come in as one of the earliest members of the company and play a pivotal role in building the technology, team, and culture from the ground up.

Details are light since we’re still in stealth mode, but we have raised funding from VCs who have invested in companies like Nest, Bonobos, and Snap. If you’re interested, please send me an email with a brief note and a link to your portfolio.
Contact: ecommerce.startup3@gmail.com

Daisee | Product Manager - Product Designer - UX specialists | Melbourne | Onsite | Fulltime
Daisee is building (among other things) call centre analytics software. We've raised over $8m and are well established with a staff of 40 people. The development team is roughly 10 engineers plus a few data scientists.

For each of these roles the more experience you have in call centres the better; for the product designer and UX roles there's a chance that you might end up supporting other applications we are developing, so call centre experience isn't super-important. Product experience with AI applications (natural language processing and machine learning) would be helpful as well.

For the right candidate we would consider someone working out of our Sydney (St Leonard's) office, but ideally you would be working from Melbourne (Cremorne).

BlueSky Education | Senior Software Engineer | Guildford, UK | Onsite | Full-time
BlueSky is looking for its first in-house, full-time software engineer in Guildford, UK.

Over 17 years, our pioneering team has made BlueSky the UK's leading performance management tool in the field of education. BlueSky is a web-based software product that drives professional development for tens of thousands of teachers.

You will be our first in-house engineer. You will gradually take charge of engineering practice that we've successfully contracted out for 17 years. In the long term we will look to you to set standards for future engineers and help recruit a larger team. There is the opportunity for this to become an executive level role within 12-24 months.
Educators are our lifeblood here at BlueSky – we need you to care about their careers as much as we do.
Responsibilities
Responsibilities:

You'll be reporting to the Managing Director, Denise Inwood, who also designed and specified the BlueSky software.

In the short term, you will need to take ownership of our 50,000 line Rails 3 code base and deliver improvements alongside our outsourcing partner.

You'll be stepping into a multi-disciplinary team of server, front-end & database experts who are part of our outsourcing company, and will be a major part of BlueSky for years to come. You'll build a working relationship with their team, plan engineering work with them and manage a slow transition of ownership.

More details and application instructions -> http://bit.ly/2M3FSe4
(If you recognise my handle, you'll know this isn't my company - I founded bytemark.co.uk and did lots of hiring of engineers over the years. Since leaving Bytemark I'm helping BlueSky create their own engineering department, and I'll be assisting with the recruitment process - this will the first move of many!).

We have a openings for mid and senior level positions. Please see our website for a very detailed job description written by a developer for developers. No plain, repetitive, HR riddled job description here, we want you to know what you are really getting into:

https://www.level12.io/careers/

- We have an engineering first culture. Good engineering principles and strategy drives business development decisions, not the other way around.

- We are not a startup. We are committed to steady and sustainable growth that doesn't sacrifice engineering excellence or our people for numbers.

- If you apply as instructed, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!

- We have a commitment to transparency and offer a “no surprises experience” throughout the interview and hiring process.

- We practice and preach sound development practices. You are likely to learn and grow as a developer while working here.

- You will have the option of working from home (US only) or our office, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.

- We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are designed so that you actually use them.

- A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.

- You are committed to automated testing of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).
- You recognize that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming.

Orbit | Frontend with some full stack | Onsite | Full time | React, Typescript, Electron
Post-funding, pre-market startup, you are the first to join so this is ideally a first-developer or even co-founder type role with appropriate responsibility/equity depending.

Let's build a better app platform. To start, by focusing on companies' knowledge based apps. Think: unified search, profiles, and company vocabulary.

But let's make it fun. Using a novel OCR engine we're realizing a leap in computing: the augmented OS; Orbit understands every word on screen in realtime (with <1% battery hit), uses new NLP to sort it into your history by topics/interests. You can organize knowledge using the various apps, or just see context to whatever you're looking at currently using a slick dropdown with quick actions.

And thats just the start. It can eventually power some impressive things down the road from relevancy based on activity to company news based on disambiguated "attention ranking".

Don't you wish desktop apps:

- Stored data in a standardized format using SQLite

- Could share and access data separately from the apps themselves

- Could be easily built with hot reloading and using a shared component kit your team can maintain

- Could be deployed without infrastructure using p2p -- one click deploy

- Instantly launched just like spotlight

- Had reactive queries, a beautiful/large/themeable UI kit, virtual lists and tables, natural language APIs, all typed

- Could go cross platform/device easily

- (insert your ideas here!)

If you love programming in general, are passionate about product, think Bret Victor is great, and generally want to try and make a big difference in the world, please get in touch with me. I need one or two really great developers as it's more fun to do things like this with a passionate team than alone.

We are launching a new product that is a big departure from our 3-month in-person training:

- For a monthly fee (3 different price points), our customers receive a topic that our teachers prepare in depth. For example, an exciting new technique that just came out in a paper and that is really applicable in the industry today

- There's code that implements the technique, but the most important part is that we provide a detailed explanation and references to every bit of knowledge you need to understand the topic. With exercises that are self-correcting (you write code, press a button, get red/green)

- This business model works well B2C, but it's something easy to consume for big corporates that want to train their people on-the-job (the current 3-month retreat doesn't address this need well). It's all very 'hands on' and more advanced than the usual MOOCs. We suspect MOOCs are not creating data scientists, at least not when done on-the-job. If we can demonstrate results, this should be an easy sell.

As Director of this product, these could be your day to day activities:
- Think up methods to increase our pipeline, together with marketing
- Pay attention to KPIs for recurrent business, for example, churn
- Decide which proportion of revenue goes to service the base, and which to invest in R&D
- Look at customer lifetime value (you don't need to calculate it, we have a resident expert on the team)
- Experiment with variations of product and pricing
- Do outbound sales to convince companies to try our service

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.

Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | ONSITE/REMOTE, Full-time | $160-$200K | https://boards.greenhouse.io/thanx/jobs/903207
Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.
Thanx is fundamentally changing that. Thanx personalizes every interaction between a merchant and their best customers, resulting in measurable increases in revenue for merchants and far greater personalization for consumers. How?
•	Through proprietary partnerships with credit card networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Amex), Thanx can reward consumers for their purchases and deliver highly-customized promotions
•	Through our interactive dashboard, Thanx makes even the smallest marketing team a data-science driven expert in personalization - right message to the right customer at the right time through the right channel.
•	By measuring our success based on revenue generated (not opens and clicks of emails)
Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital).
Thanx Engineering
•	Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from successful product companies like Disney, Google, and Facebook. This is an elite engineering team, period.
•	Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform -- adopted Golang, Elasticsearch, NLP, React, React Native, GraphQL, and added 5+ new microservices; all in the last 12 months. And we are just getting started.
•	Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours and PTO policy. We work and play hard -- be warned, when it comes to Mario Kart, we are super competitive!

Clarisights | Frontend, Backend, Data engineers | Bangalore, India | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs | 8L - 30L
Clarisights is an data ingestion and analytics platform that enables marketers to make sense of and gain unique insights from data coming in from all the sources (analytics, ads data, CRM, Payroll, etc). Our platform is a seamless in browser experience - the users just add the data sources they want to track, our backend then pulls in data from those resources and stores it into our own database. The user then proceeds to the visualisation page to create the required data visualisations.
Clarisights was founded to empower performance marketing and growth teams by creating a platform that gives them insights and superhero powers they have always wanted. Rather than wrestling with outdated spreadsheets and BI platforms that can't keep pace with their growing volume of marketing channels and data, marketers can use Clarisights to independently explore and analyse all their data in a single and intuitive interface. Marketing teams around the world use Clarisights for every aspect of their performance marketing workflow - from integrating with data channels, creating and optimising dashboards, and collaborating with teammates - all in real time!

We have found product market fit and have recently closed a $2M round from top European VC's. Currently a team of 20 people looking to scale.

We're looking for frontend, backend and data engineers at all levels (Architects, senior, mid-level and interns). https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs

We deal with a lot of data and need real-time responses - you will have an opportunity to work on some really hard engineering problems. We often run into performance issues in popular open source tools and libraries - we don't hesitate to find the bottlenecks and fix them. Team is lead by Ex-Google and Ex-Facebook folks who've got lots of experience building scalable production software.

Tech stack :

Clarisights | Frontend, Backend, Data engineers | Bangalore, India | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs | 8L - 30L
Clarisights is an data ingestion and analytics platform that enables marketers to make sense of and gain unique insights from data coming in from all the sources (analytics, ads data, CRM, Payroll, etc). Our platform is a seamless in browser experience - the users just add the data sources they want to track, our backend then pulls in data from those resources and stores it into our own database. The user then proceeds to the visualisation page to create the required data visualisations.

Clarisights was founded to empower performance marketing and growth teams by creating a platform that gives them insights and superhero powers they have always wanted. Rather than wrestling with outdated spreadsheets and BI platforms that can't keep pace with their growing volume of marketing channels and data, marketers can use Clarisights to independently explore and analyse all their data in a single and intuitive interface. Marketing teams around the world use Clarisights for every aspect of their performance marketing workflow - from integrating with data channels, creating and optimising dashboards, and collaborating with teammates - all in real time!

We have found product market fit and have recently closed a $2M round from top European VC's. Currently a team of 20 people looking to scale.

We're looking for frontend, backend and data engineers at all levels (Architects, senior, mid-level and interns). https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs

We deal with a lot of data and need real-time responses - you will have an opportunity to work on some really hard engineering problems. We often run into performance issues in popular open source tools and libraries - we don't hesitate to find the bottlenecks and fix them. Team is lead by Ex-Google and Ex-Facebook folks who've got lots of experience building scalable production software.

Tech stack :

Backend : PostGres, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, Ruby on Rails (we're considering a migration to Elixir or GoLang). Hosted on Google cloud platform.
Frontend : React, Redux, Styled components, Jest, FlowType, WebPack, etc.

Pachyderm -- San Francisco -- onsite preferred, but remote possible (within US) -- https://jobs.lever.co/pachyderm/
Love Docker, Golang, and distributed systems?

Pachyderm is an enterprise data science platform.

Teams that find themselves struggling to maintain a growing mess of advance data science tasks such as machine learning or bioinformatics/genomics research use Pachyderm to greatly simplify their system and reduce development time.  They rely on Pachyderm to do the heavy lifting so they can focus on the business logic in their data pipelines.

Check us out at:

https://pachyderm.com/

http://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm

What would data analytics infrastructure (namely Hadoop) look like if we rebuilt it from scratch today? We think it would be containerized, modular, and easy enough for a single person to use while still being scalable enough for a whole company. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes provide the perfect building blocks for us revolutionize data infrastructure!

Pachyderm just raised our Series A led by Benchmark (https://pachyderm.io/2018/11/15/Series-A.html), so you'd be getting in right at the ground floor and have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company as well as building the rest of the engineering team.

Positions:

* Core distributed systems/infrastructure engineer (Golang)- You’ll be solving hard algorithmic and distributed systems problems every day and building a first-of-its-kind, containerized, data infrastructure platform.

* Front-end Engineer (Javascript) - Your work will be focused on developing the UI, perfecting the user experience, and pioneering new products such as a hosted version of Pachyderm's data solution.
* Lead Data Science Evangelist -- be the face of Pachyderm and get OSS users excited! Build machine learning and data science examples, write blog posts, give conference talks, and generally just evangelize Go, Docker, and Kubernetes!

NEAR Protocol | Developer Evangelist | San Francisco | Full-time | ONSITE
## About the Role

As a developer evangelist, your mission is to educate and engage early adopters and the broader developer community about the NEAR platform by telling a compelling story and backing it up with practical examples.  That means doing whatever it takes to bring them into our developer community and keep them actively and happily building within it while learning from their experiences.

Practically speaking, this means that you will wear a lot of hats.  As the core protocol is developed, you will be a key interface with the early adopter community to make sure they will have a great experience on the platform when it is released.  You’ll need to build developer tools, write demos/tutorials and otherwise do pretty much whatever it takes to ensure developers have a great experience onboarding to and using the platform.

Going forward, you will be a visible presence representing NEAR in communities around the world by working directly with our events and community teams.  This means everything from speaking to hosting workshops to supporting developers at events. You are the voice of the community to our internal team as well, helping to inform the development and education roadmaps.

This is a role that will allow you to build real software and also take a public-facing role representing the platform to developer communities.  It is one part engineering, one part community and one part education with a sprinkle of marketing and PR. You will be based in San Francisco but travel is a necessary component to support events around the world.

Apply at https://nearprotocol.com/careers?gh_jid=4106601002

## About NEAR

NEAR is a scalable blockchain and smart contract platform designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption.  Unlike other next generation blockchains, this network’s performance both scales with the total number of nodes and allows those nodes to be run on low-end devices like mobile phones, bringing potentially billions of them into the network and providing a direct path to end users.

Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) | Scientific Software Developer | Zurich/Lugano, Switzerland | Onsite | Full-time
The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) is operated by ETH Zurich and develops and provides key supercomputing capabilities required to solve important problems in science and society.

The Scientific Software and Libraries group at CSCS is looking for developers who love writing stable, performance-portable, scientific software for the latest HPC systems. We have multiple open positions at both the ETH Hönggerberg campus in Zurich, and at the CSCS headquarters in Lugano. Your work will involve long term projects of at least one year in duration. Projects involve either close collaboration with a scientific collaborator, or work in small internal team working on software for use across multiple projects. Some examples of projects you might work on are:

- Template meta-programming and domain specific languages to accelerate climate and weather codes on accelerated architectures

- Quantum chemical and material science applications used for the prediction of novel materials

- Optimising and wrapping sparse linear algebra and mesh codes for our finite element and finite volume users

- Combining low-level optimization with task-based parallelism at extreme scale to perform fast linear algebra on the world's largest systems

- Communication-avoiding parallel algorithms

If you have a soft spot for bootstrapped, profitable companies with a meaningful product, and you want to use your frontend development skills for good, you’ll like this.
About us:

Drops’ goal is to turn language learning into a delightful game while ensuring effective learning. We teach 31 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - and received the “Best of 2018” title this year! - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe. We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and have releases multiple times a week. We want to be the #1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 9 million, a monthly active of >1,000,000 and an average store rating of 4.7. You can find us here: https://languagedrops.com

About you:

You’ll be responsible for establishing Drops on the web, from a technical perspective. This means a lot of ownership, which we cultivate by having a flat structure.

You’re a no-nonsense person, who is comfortable taking on and managing multiple different projects at the same time, who has been working in working at a product company and has extensive front-end development experience.

You have been working with React for years, have deep knowledge of everything that’s happening in the browser and looking for challenges in growing a product from tens of thousands to millions of visitors per month.

You strongly prefer static typing over dynamic languages, and use every opportunity to transform code that doesn’t use types into code that does. You generally prefer to use a minimal set of simple tools to a diverse range of complex ones.

We’ve built our mobile app with react-native, so we can easily port it to the web and start sharing most of our code - and the challenges that this brings are of your interest.

You like to have a variety of projects - at this job, you’ll be developing a complex web app, a static site generator (gatsby), and even sometimes helping out on our marketing website, that’s being re-built with webflow.

We want everyone to see the big picture: this means you already pushed your boundaries outside of “being a developer” and are knowledgeable about web product growth frameworks, SEO, best practices regarding retention and monetization.

We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product & driven to grow professionally, than in managing people.

We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and freedom. You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.
Please apply through via the following link: https://drops.workable.com/j/6DC995B44D

We work together to ship code every day and are constantly looking for ways to improve. We are responsible for a suite of long-lived products that receive constant innovation, feedback, iteration, maintenance, and new feature development.

Software engineers at Second Street are fully involved in every part of the process, from planning, to developing, to testing, to launch. We care deeply and we do things right: version control, automated testing, code reviews, and occasional pair programming. We also focus on work-life balance, including a flexible schedule and work-from-home opportunities, so you won’t be burning the midnight oil here. As a senior front-end software engineer you'll help your teammates work through particularly vexing issues and guide them as they build larger projects, all while keeping an eye toward usability and user experience thanks to your front-end experience.

COMPANY SUMMARY:

Proda | Senior Full stack engineers | London | Full-time | ONSITE | 50-85k + equity doe.
Proda is an investor-backed, data-mining startup for the commercial real estate industry; we're making data entry jobs less painful. Our clients have been beta testing our application and the feedback's been incredible: https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2018/11/01/proptech-startup-pa...

What about the team? We have a high emphasis on continual learning. If you're not learning something new on the job its time for a new one. Our tech stack reflects this; Haskell and Elm are the main languages. We don't mind if its your first exposure to either. We're not afraid of experimenting or making mistakes. The most important quality of anyone on our team is their ability to learn and teach. Our sales pipeline is miles ahead of our development and we're looking to grow the team to deliver more feature our customers. Since we're still young, working with us means you have a lot of influence in shaping the culture and direction of the company. You'll also a chance to grow your skill set faster than somewhere else.

What about The product? We're building a data mining tool that can explicitly learn a relational data model based on sample inputs. It radically improves data entry and data cleaning for financial analysts. Customers have loved our demos and we're understandably coy in our public descriptions.

This is for someone who:

* is comfortable in functional programming, especially Haskell & Elm; and * is experienced shipping complex web software to production; and * has an eagerness to learn and willingness to share knowledge.

A Typical Day looks like:

* Start off writing a feature that requires elm-ports. These can be tricky, so you pair with another developer who has shipped such code before.

* After lunch you're requested to review a Pull Request that fixes a bug you accidentally introduced a couple weeks back. There's no blame, instead some discussion about how our tests and review process could have caught this earlier.

* The afternoon is spent with the Product guys around a whiteboard. You're helping them sketch out architecture for a complex new data-auditing feature that we'll need to deliver a couple of sprints down the line.

We're far more interested in your capacity to learn then the arcana of specific tech tools, but our platform is largely composed of:


  - Haskell
  - Elm
  - PostgreSQL
  - Python / scikit-learn
  - AWS
  - Automated Testing and CI/CD.

The Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) | https://www.mpi-sws.org/ | PhD applicants and interns | Saarbrücken / Kaiserslautern, Germany | ONSITE | VISA and INTERNS | English-language
I am Jonathan Mace, and I am a faculty member at MPI-SWS (my position is equivalent to a US assistant professor).  I lead the Cloud Software Systems research group, and I am actively looking for new PhD students to join my group in fall 2019.  I am also hiring interns year-round (interns are typically at the late-stage undergrad or graduate level).

A quick brief about the institute more generally: MPI-SWS is a world-class academic research institution located in the German cities of Saarbrücken and Kaiserslautern.  Our faculty are world leaders in many research areas including cloud & distributed systems, computer networks, operating systems, security, privacy, programming languages, verification, and more.  All students admitted to our PhD program receive full funding for the duration of their PhD.  Structurally, our PhD program is similar to those found at US research universities, with longer-duration PhDs, flexibility to move between research groups, and a multicultural, English-language working environment.

More specifically about my research group: My group's goal is to make it easier to operate large software systems and to understand their behavior at runtime.  Our research entails designing new abstractions for building distributed systems, new techniques for measuring and understanding their performance, and new tools for analyzing their behavior both online and offline.  The kind of questions we ask include things like:

* When you put together a complex distributed system, how do you know what it's doing when you run it?

* Is my distributed system performing well? Did I configure it correctly?

* When things go wrong -- like a crash, or if things are really slow -- how do I figure out why?

* If I'm building a new system, what choices can I make so that it's easier to understand and analyze its behavior later?

* How can multiple users effectively and efficiently share a distributed system without impacting each other?

The type of systems we work with include those offered by public cloud providers (Google Cloud, AWS), open-source systems like those in the Hadoop ecosystem, and emerging paradigms like microservice architectures and function-as-a-service platforms.  My group's research has a significant practical element, and applicants will need to be comfortable diving into unfamiliar code bases and rapidly prototyping new ideas.

If this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to get in touch with me directly (mention seeing this ad for bonus points).  My contact details and more information about my group's research can be found here: https://people.mpi-sws.org/~jcmace

General information about PhDs at MPI-SWS can be found at https://www.mpi-sws.org/graduate-studies
Lastly, applications should be submitted at https://apply.mpi-sws.org

Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers-venmo-robinhood-and-other-big-apps.html). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of distributed, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but also want to have flexibility in where they work.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:

You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.

You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.

You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.

You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.

You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

NoRedInk | Full-Stack Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Abl Schools | Frontend Engineer, Data Scientist, Support Engineer | San Francisco |Full-time | ONSITE | www.ablschools.com
Technology has made the world more connected, fundamentally changing how we live, work and interact; yet traditional schools have not evolved to prepare students for the 21st century. Replacing textbooks with tablets won’t be enough. We believe schools need a new foundation. That’s why we’re building a web-based school scheduling platform, that allows administrators to put master schedules and daily calendars into a single cloud-based system. We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools. We are also a company that deeply values diversity in every way.

View openings, including sales, engineering, customer success, and design on our site: https://ablschools.com/careers/

--------------------------------------------------

Personal note: I've been on the Abl engineering team for over a year and I love it. The mission and the team make coming into work _awesome_. We have a diverse team, we're well funded, we have experienced leadership... I could go on. The interview process is, in my opinion, very fair. You won't be asked to white board and we understand that the process is just as much the candidate getting to know the company as it is the other way around.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me - my contact info is in my profile.

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Data Scientist:

The Role

We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You’ll collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers, and school leaders to build software features that help schools overcome complex logistical challenges.

As a Data Scientist at Abl, your work will immediately improve equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype, with engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.

Recent data science projects include:

Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking

The Team

Our product research and development team is small, passionate, and inclusive. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.

As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.

Responsibilities

+ Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, and predictive models)

+ Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl’s product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production

+ Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling

+ Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools

+ Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources

+ Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate

+ Determine how to evaluate equity, or fairness, for students and for teachers

+ Propose metrics for evaluating the overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules’ ability to meet school leader priorities

+ Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school data

Qualifications

+ Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)

+ Proficiency in writing SQL queries

+ Ability and desire to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences (e.g., in writing, through reporting tools, and at in-person presentations)

+ Experience with cleaning, structuring, and transforming data via ETL processes

+ Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Front-End Engineer:

We are seeking a Front-End Software Engineer to join our team and help build products that support our mission. We are growing quickly and there is a lot to do! Your contributions will have a meaningful impact on our company.

Your Impact

+ Work collaboratively with the Product and Design team to understand the experiences and pain points of schools, teachers, and students

+ Define and build compelling new products and exciting new features that give educators insights that will enable them to optimize how they use their resources

+ Use your extensive knowledge of front-end technologies to build high-quality designs that are scalable

+ Manage code review, increase performance, and communicate best front-end engineering practices

+ Create a first of its kind interface that will progress K-12 schools and their communities

Qualifications

+ Experience with Javascript frameworks such as React, Backbone, Angular etc.

+ You should have a great feel for user experience and an eye for beautiful designs

+ Bring a deep understanding of best practices in design, optimization, interaction, and usability

+ Familiarity with the whole web stack, including protocols and web server optimization techniques

--------------------------------------------------

Support Engineer:

Abl’s Schools team is seeking a data-savvy Support Engineer to ensure customers are set up for success in our product. This person will provide direct technical assistance to customers, assisting with post-sales onboarding, configuration setup, and data manipulation tasks. In addition to assisting customers, the Support Engineer will interface directly with the Implementation Manager and Engineering to contribute to projects related to ETL tools and data solutions. The candidate should be familiar with basic programming and data management, and be passionate about helping schools use the master schedule as a lever for change.

Responsibilities

+ Collaborate with customers to initiate and schedule data transfers from school sites to Abl’s internal database

+ Write scripts to transform, validate and transport data as part of the ETL process

+ Provide first-line technical support to customers and implement ad-hoc data solutions

+ Support account managers with documentation and research around customer specifications

+ Create and update SQL-based reports to provide key customer success metrics to larger team and to inform product and implementation decisions

Qualifications

+ Proficient in at least one scripting language (e.g. Ruby, Python, JavaScript)

+ Experience with data analysis and management (Excel, SQL, reporting tools, etc.)

+ Customer-facing experience in technical role

+ Eagerness to work in a mission-driven, startup environment

+ 2+ years of experience in support of technical products
+ Former experience with a K12 edtech company or in a school-level role a plus

BitMEX | SF |Sr Security, K8S, API/Node |On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.
Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!
