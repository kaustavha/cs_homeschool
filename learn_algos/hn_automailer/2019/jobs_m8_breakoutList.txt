Discord | Security Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime | ~$150k - $250k base + equity + hoodies (equity/hoodie split subject to negotiation)
Hello friends! We're hiring engineers for our brand new security engineering team. Check out the description here: https://discordapp.com/jobs/4362278002

Historically, Discord hasn't had a dedicated security team -- we just happen to have a small handful of engineers with a strong enough security background to pick up this kind of work in their spare time. We've since grown to the point where we finally have enough work to justify a full time security engineering team. Note that this team isn't just infrastructure security (although it certainly includes that) -- we'll also be building product features, new backend services, internal tooling, and more. If you have a solid grasp on software development, an extensive security background, and are excited about helping build a security team from the ground up, please get in touch!

Of course, if you're interested in working at Discord but not in this particular role, we have plenty of other openings at https://discordapp.com/jobs (but I'm not the hiring manager for those).
If you have any questions (about the role, Discord, resume advice, or whatever you feel like), feel free to add me on Discord at cmFtc2V5IzAwMDE=. Do note that I probably won't respond if it's a weekend (and your DM might get buried under the avalanche of work-related DMs by Monday). Last time I did this someone messaged me three Saturdays in a row and then angrily blocked me because I wasn't responding. If you're reading this: I'm sorry! Just message me on a weekday! :)

https://www.rxrx.ai/

We have raised over $200M to apply machine learning to one of the most unique datasets in existence - over 12 billion images of cells under a huge number of biological and chemical perturbations, generated in our own labs - in order to find treatments for hundreds of diseases. Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies.
