Portchain | Copenhagen, Denmark | Full time | REMOTE | Front-end and full stack Software Engineers
We're hiring two full stack or front-end developers (NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL, Python) to join our team of 4 remote developers (incl. the engineering manager onsite in Copenhagen).

Experience working remotely. Minimum 4 years of professional software engineering experience.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and starting to get traction through pilot projects, therefore looking for 2 new members to join our team.

Old Reliable | Software Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE (UK)
Old Reliable is a remote-first software consultancy & development house based in the UK. We’re a young, ambitious company but we’re focussed more on having a sustainable work-life balance than on slaving away until midnight 6 (or 7!) days a week.

We offer flexible working in a laid-back environment. You’ll manage yourself and be responsible for the delivery of a project from start to finish. You’ll need to be open to learning & applying new technologies. You’ll probably be working on a new project every few months.

At this point we’re not asking for a specific skillset. The projects we’ll be able to take on in the future will depend on your abilities and interests. To date we’ve worked on C/C++ and build systems (cmake, assorted CI systems, conda-forge) so if you have experience in the area, that would be a plus.

We are strongly against the idea that remote workers should earn more or less money depending on where they live. The value you add to a company doesn’t depend on your cost of living. If you want to earn a London salary without having to live in London, let’s talk.

If you're interested, shoot me an email: charlie.stigler@workday.com

Onzin Incorporated - San Francisco, California, USA [REMOTE]
Greetings! We are a small business in the US looking to hire a backend or DevOps engineer to work remotely with our team full or part time. The team is several engineers already, and you would be joining them in supporting our ongoing internal and external projects by helping to set up and provision backend systems and services, as well as some light application programming like API servers.

Our work is a combination of in-house projects with external client engagements filling in the gaps. For this role we would be looking for deep experience with back-end and infrastructure technologies like Amazon AWS or Google GCP, provisioning tools like Ansible / Puppet / Salt, Python development, shell scripting, Linux system administration, docker and containerization technologies, build and deploy servers, CloudFormation and Terraform for infrastructure management, as well as some basic networking skills. There will also be tasks involving setting up backend components like databases, job queues, and micro-services.

This is a great role for mid or senior level engineers who are looking for flexibility and some independence in how their work gets completed. Do note that while we are excited to be growing our business and adding a new position this year, we will likely remain a small team for the foreseeable future. We are also not a traditional ‘product’ company, and most of our time is spent on smaller applications and projects that eventually reach completion.
If you would like to know more, send a message to hiring@onzininc.com with your questions. To apply, please send a resume and few remarks about your background and technical experience to the same address. Thank you for reading, and good luck out there!

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. 9 Months ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+2 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly. (P.S. I'm on holiday, so it will be at least a week before I reply)

OpenMessage | Platform, Analytics & Dev Tools Engineer | https://openmessage.io | NYC | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE in North America, EST timezone | $80-$120k + 0.1-2%
Hey fellow engineers and future colleagues,

We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services.

It's also pretty awesome that goal-oriented conversations are like conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our decision making so there is a lot of impactful work to do.

We are starting to share our API with other companies and need to create a great developer experience for them. This new role will get to own the open source SDK and client libraries, CLIs, documentation, key management etc. Same goes for logging, BI, and infrastructure for the developer ecosystem.

Our main tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. We prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles over cleverness and magic.

We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy. No jerks allowed, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!

There is a small take-home project that covers basic data transformation and schema design. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding exercises. Open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.

We will have an interview to go over implementation choices, ideas, and discuss technology. Then we do a couple with other team members to cover general topics like management philosophy, industry and market perspectives, intellectual motivations, professional development trajectory, office environment, interpersonal style etc.
Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!

Indigo Agriculture | Senior GraphQL API Engineer, Senior React Engineer | Boston, MA | ONSITE | Full-time |
Our mission is to improve farmer profitability while pulling chemicals out of our food supply and making healthier food in the process.  You can read about Indigo's mission here: https://www.indigoag.com/about

More specifically for these roles: my team is building a Marketplace (https://www.indigoag.com/indigo-marketplace) where farmers can sell their crops direct to buyers without having to go through a middle-man, who historically takes a good part of the profits and disincentivizes the farmer from producing high-quality, sustainable crops since they all get mixed together.  In Indigo's Marketplace, farmers that product premium crops (Non-gmo, Organic, low toxins) get a premium price.  We're essentially building a market like the Nasdaq, but with many more dimensions (different crops, quality, selling windows), with heavy geographic components (buyers and sellers need to be close) and a bunch of different pricing options (hedging, futures, etc...), so there is no shortage of fun, complex problems to solve.

We use React, TypeScript and Apollo (GraphQL) on the front end and Node, TypeScript and GraphQL on the back end.  The combination of TypeScript on both the front and back ends and GraphQL in the middle allows us to be type-safe from the DB all the way to the web page where the data is bound.  We're been GraphQL since day one and are huge fans.

Please reach out to me directly at dcaddigan@indigoag.com or apply directly via the links below.  If you apply directly, write a note saying you're coming from Hacker News.

* Senior GraphQL API Engineer - https://boards.greenhouse.io/indigo/jobs/659135

* Senior React Engineer - https://boards.greenhouse.io/indigo/jobs/666210
Also note that we have some remote contractors and our processes are set up to handle full-time remote folks, we just haven't pulled the trigger on the right person yet.  If you'd need to be remote full-time and think you're a great match for the position, please reach out!

Expensify is the most widely used expense management system in the world, with millions of users and more customers than the rest of the industry combined, processing billions of real dollars annually. And this year, we've overdone ourselves, because as you might have heard, we're doing a Super Bowl commercial. Crazy, right? That's not even the best part. We've made the world's first music video you can expense. Check out https://www.expensifythis.com to enter the Expensify This contest and watch the full music video.

We have ~130 employees, are self-managed (no VC control), are extremely profitable, and are working to buy back all shares to become 100% employee owned, intending to create liquidity through internal buyback programs and eventual dividends. As an equal member of the team:


  - Your voice will carry weight on day one.
  - Your responsibilities will increase quickly and without limit, as there is virtually no formal management structure to constrain your growth.
  - You will work on every part of the codebase, without being constrained to any team, layer, or platform.
  - You will receive a fair, proactive raise bi-annually, without you needing to ask.  
  - You will have the option (not required) to travel with the team domestically and internationally multiple times a year -- spouses and kids welcome (and paid for).  
  - You will be provided the best equipment, a personal mentor committed to your success, tools to encourage a healthy work/life balance, and a workplace that is safe, respectful, collaborative, and inspiring.
  - You will be truly welcome regardless of age, race, gender, orientation, or other affiliation.

Some of the cool things we're working on:

  - Concierge, a “supervised learning” AI-powered customer support platform
  - BedrockDB.com, an open-source, blockchain-based SQL database atop SQLite
  - SmartScan, an OCR/human receipt transcription service
  - Next day ACH processing many millions of dollars daily
  - Scaling realtime search across 30 days (16TB) of system logs
  - Cutting edge web/mobile technologies and so much more!

We are very proud of the team we have built, and would love to have you join our large extended family around the world.  We are happy to sponsor visas and greencards as needed.  All we ask in return is that you get shit done, without ruining it for everyone else: https://blog.expensify.com/2016/06/03/rule-1-get-shit-done/  To apply, just email answers to the following questions to jobs@expensify.com (no resume needed):

  [1] What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?
  [2] Tell us about what it is you do (programming, systems engineering, sales, etc.), when you started, and what you've done between then and now.
  [3] What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?
  [4] How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.

TalkJS (https://talkjs.com) | Eindhoven (the Netherlands) | REMOTE (Europe/Africa only)
TalkJS is the chat platform for platforms. We help online marketplaces and communities build great user-to-user communication. Working at TalkJS is fun because you get to make software that is used by other software engineers and that significantly impacts the experience of the users of our customers. Currently we're looking for:

SENIOR FULL-STACK DEVELOPER

Our product is directly used by other developers, so there's deep API design work involved. We want to be faster at shipping new features and making existing features better, which is where you come in. Additionally, we're facing some big scaling challenges. Because of all this, we're looking for an experienced programmer who wants to help get TalkJS to the next level. Our stack consists of Elixir, PostgreSQL, React and TypeScript, but it's acceptable if you don't know all of these as long as you know many others.

We expect you to be fluent in at least 2 programming languages, and to have demonstrably deep experience with either Single-Page Web Applications, or relational databases, and at least some experience in both.

EXPERIENCED MOBILE DEVELOPER

We're about to significantly up our game on iOS and Android. Developer productivity is a core selling point in our TalkJS, so we're looking for someone who thinks they'd be good at designing the best mobile chat API ever made.

We expect you to have extensive experience on both iOS and Android, so that you're able to not just build a usable SDK, but a delightful SDK on both platforms that meshes well with each platform's idioms and conventions.

TECHNICAL SALESPERSON / VP OF SALES

Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing and we're looking for help with (mostly inbound) sales. Our customers are entrepreneurs, product managers and engineers who ask highly technical questions. This means that some experience with software products is required. Ideally you can code a little bit.

You're able to quickly build mutual trust, you're great in (video) calls, and you never let a lead out of your sight. You're able to formulate questions and answers to technical matters precisely and unambiguously so that our dev team can help you close deals. You love software products and you'd love to work with product people all day (both at TalkJS and at our customers).

We're growing quickly and this is our first commercial hire. You're interested and able build out and lead the sales team as the company grows.

ABOUT YOU

Our team is small and highly proactive, and we expect the same from you. If you need to be told what to do all the time, don't apply. If you want to be the smartest person in a (chat) room full of interns, don't apply. If you want to move fast with an experienced team, get in touch.
Apply by sending an email to hey@talkjs.com. (no recruiters or agencies please)
