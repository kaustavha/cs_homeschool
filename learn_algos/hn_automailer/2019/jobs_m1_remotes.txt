Neos are combining smart home devices and home insurance to make people's homes safer, and reduce the number of claims being paid out. We closed funding from Aviva, one the UK's largest insurers, late last year and we're now looking to grow the team. We sell our own insurance policies, and also provide a white labelled version of our IoT platform to insurers around the world.

Specifically we're looking for mid-level/senior developers on both frontend and backend, project managers, product managers, designers, and QA engineers. For most of those roles we can hire people working in London, Brighton, or remote if you can demonstrate previous experience of doing so effectively.

Our tech stack consists of lots of Ruby (and a little bit of Elixir) on the backend, Angular SPAs on the frontend, mobile apps for iOS and Android, alongside hardware from a variety of suppliers which we integrate with our platform.
You can see the full job specs at https://neos.workable.com, but if you have any questions feel free to drop me an email on jon.wood@neos.co.uk and I'll either answer or find the right person to do so.

## Responsibilities:

• Imports meshes from our segmentation algorithms

• Develop 3D UI for displaying STL files/3D meshes

• Manipulation tools: rotation, translation, smoothing, extrusion etc

• Visualization of meshes eg. collision detection

• Interpolation of translation/rotation between keyframes

• Exporting meshes to our API

Working at TalkJS is fun because you get to make software that is used by other software engineers and that significantly impacts the experience of the users of our customers. Currently we're looking for a:

SENIOR FULL-STACK DEVELOPER

Our product is directly used by other developers, so there's deep API design work involved. We want to be faster at shipping new features and making existing features better, which is where you come in. Additionally, we're facing some big scaling challenges. Because of all this, we're looking for an experienced programmer who wants to help get TalkJS to the next level. Our stack consists of Elixir, PostgreSQL, React and TypeScript, but it's acceptable if you don't know all of these as long as you know many others.

ABOUT YOU

We expect you to be fluent in at least 2 programming languages, and to have demonstrably deep experience with either Single-Page Web Applications, or relational databases, and at least some experience in both.

Our team is small and highly proactive, and we expect the same from you. If you need to be told what to do all the time, don't apply. If you want to be the smartest person in a (chat) room full of interns, don't apply. If you want to move fast with an experienced team, get in touch.
Apply by sending an email to hey@talkjs.com. (no recruiters or agencies please)

Zapier | BE/Python Engineer, FE/React Engineer, Test Automation Engineer, Engineering Manager, Engineering Director (soon) | Earth | 100% REMOTE | https://zapier.com/jobs/
Zapier is 100% remote from YC S12. We're just over 7 years old, wrapped 2018 with 200 folks across 20+ countries -- about 75 of those are engineers! We're sustainably profitable and have a lot of cool stuff we want to do in 2019 to bring automation to the masses.

If you haven't heard of Zapier, we're sort of like Legos for the internet -- we help people build workflows around SaaS software or other online productivity tools. We're doing well, but we have a lot of work to do still. I think 2019 might be Zapier's most exciting year to date! :-)

We're also doing a lot of technical investment in 2019 around simplifying and scaling the product, evolving the architectural design, and of course a bit of tech debt reduction (which is mostly deleting code without breaking anything!).

We're also going to be hiring a Director/Manager-of-Managers layer as well as some Security Engineers in early 2019, but the job posts aren't up yet. If you are interested in those, maybe drop me a line bryan@zapier.com?

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 8 months ago I moved to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We’ve hired 3 remote developers so far and it’s been a great experience!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+2 to GMT+8 should be OK.
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Pirate Studios is building music rehearsal studios in multiple countries, and we're big on tech in our studios. We're the biggest rehearsal studio provider in the UK and rapidly expanding abroad. We build our own studios that are open 24/7, and all booking is handled online.

We're looking to add a developer to our dev team right now. Being excited about music is definitely a bonus, but we have loads of fun and exciting programming projects in the pipeline. Ideas are welcome and many of our improvements come from people in the business suggesting them.

Our current primary projects are in Ruby, JavaScript (React), Haskell, and Elixir; with a smattering of Rust and Python in IoT and ML projects. We work in small project-based teams on our various components, and we have dedicated (and good!) project managers who help give us plenty of time and space to focus on programming. Our current focus is around live streaming from inside our studios and this would be the project you'd be starting on when joining.

We're looking for someone in Bristol to join the team working in our Old Market office. Some of the dev team work remotely, but all of us are within easy distance of Bristol (or London) and we meet up regularly to discuss/work/beer together. Unfortunately we're not currently able to assist in relocation to this area.

I'm Head of Development, and working for Pirate Studios is the best job I've ever had. I'll go out of my way to make sure you get to build great things :)
Email us at tech-jobs@piratestudios.co.uk.

Bagel Health (YC W19)
First employee (Full-stack engineer)
Decent cash salary plus first-employee equity (standard vesting)
REMOTE
Work at a YC startup trying to fix healthcare! Or at least improve a small part of it.

Bagel is a new electronic health record for the growing number of doctors that don't accept insurance, particularly direct primary care (DPC) docs. DPC is trying to cut insurance out of primary care. It makes no sense to use insurance to pay for basic or routine medical services; do you use your car insurance to pay for an oil change? There are some seriously great knock-on benefits of getting rid of insurance too. Here's a good rundown: https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/09/25/direct-primary-care/

We're still in the early design phase, and we'll be starting implementation soon. We'll hit the ground running; I'd like to get a usable version out within three months.

Here's the tentative stack: Typescript, React, Apollo Client, backend on Google Cloud (App Engine, probably), GraphQL, Postgres (+ Sequelize or similar). Ideally you'd be awesome at a few of these and competent in the rest.
I'm Colin McDonnell, MIT EECS 2016, the sole founder of Bagel, and all-around nice person. If you're interested in working together, email me at colin(at)bagel(dot)md with a resume and a bit about you and why you're interested! Cheers.

Portchain | Copenhagen, Denmark | Full time | REMOTE | Front-end and full stack Software Engineers
We're hiring two full stack or front-end developers (NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL, Python) to join our team of 4 remote developers (incl. the engineering manager onsite in Copenhagen).

Experience working remotely. Minimum 4 years of professional software engineering experience.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and starting to get traction through pilot projects, therefore looking for 2 new members to join our team.

We use our tech to automate and enable, and aim to deliver relevant data and insight to our clients much more quickly than our competitors are able. We feel there's a window of opportunity open to us to disrupt the market research industry which is, in many ways, quite slow moving and traditional.

Our tech team comprises 15 people, mostly developers, along with two UX designers. I wouldn't go so far as to say based at, but we're centred on The Bradfield Centre in Cambridge, UK. However, most of our team work from home at least some of the time, and we have three substantially remote members. We've become quite proficient at working whilst spread out geographically so we're quite open to full-time remote workers as well. On top of this we also offer a 35 hour work week and flexible working hours.

We are hiring at least half a dozen talented software engineers at all levels of experience to join us. We're also looking for a couple of user experience designers with up to 3 years experience who our senior designers can mentor and develop. Regardless of our role, you’ll be working on our end to end market research, data, and insight delivery platform.

We are happy to pursue sponsorship for the right candidates looking to relocate to the UK.

Job ads will be going live next week but in the meantime...
TO APPLY: email bart.read@mig-global.com and I'll set up a call with you. This will also give you an opportunity to find out more.

BitMEX | SF |Sr Security/K8S/Node/API | On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.
Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!

Doctype | Software engineer with reverse engineering skills / Anti-cheat engineer | Stockholm, Sweden | ONSITE, VISA or REMOTE (worldwide) | Full-time / part-time | https://www.doctype.se/
We're a small digital agency based in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently around 15 people. We have an office in the heart of Stockholm, but our employees are free to work from wherever they feel most productive. We've built https://lemondogs.com/, https://www.gothiaecup.com/, https://beta.esportal.se/, amongst other websites. Our largest clients are within the eSports segment.

We’re currently looking for a software engineer with reverse engineering skills to work with us on client-sided anti-cheat technology. Our current tech stack is mainly Go, MariaDB and React, but the project you would be working on is a standalone client built in C/C++ and Assembly.

Requirements:

* Good understanding of C and x86-64 assembly

* Good understanding of the x86 architecture

* Basic understanding of the Windows NT kernel

* Eager to learn

Nice to have:

* Experience with reverse engineering malware/cheats

* Experience with reverse engineering the Windows NT kernel

* Experience with binary instrumentation

* Experience with hardware-assisted virtualization (such as VT-x and AMD-V)

* Experience with SLAT (Second Level Address Translation)

* Understanding cryptography primitives
The role we’re looking to fill is initially part-time, but may eventually grow into a full-time role. You’ll be working together with another anti-cheat engineer to combat cheaters in video games. If you’re looking for a full-time role, we may be able to offer that depending on your breadth of knowledge. We can offer relocation to Sweden and assist with housing. I’m one of the co-founders and currently hold the role as CTO. Feel free to mail me at mark@doctype.se if this sounds interesting to you!
