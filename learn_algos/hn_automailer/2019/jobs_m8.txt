Latacora | Security Engineers | Full-time | Chicago or Remote
You could pick one startup to work for. But why choose? You can also work for a bunch of them simultaneously. That's what we did. We're Latacora, and we're building a security team that runs security teams for startups. We're a weird firm: we have only one kind of client, and we work full-time with them for 6-18 months, doing everything a security team does, from software security to cryptography design to AWS and container lockdown.

We've been working together since 2005 (when we were called Matasano). And for almost as long, we've been hiring people off the HN hiring thread. We don't care about resumes or previous work experience. Rather, we're interested in aptitude and level of interest in the problems we're working on. No phone screens, no whiteboard interviews. More than you could want to know about our hiring process: https://latacora.com/careers

We're hiring 3 roles:

* Secops people, who do cloud and network security and security automation.

* Appsec people, who do software security assessments, watch PRs, and do app design meetings.

* Corpsec people, who protect endpoints and IT assets and put vendors through the security wringer.

Everyone at Latacora delivers work, from the partners on down, and everyone writes software --- so one skill you'll want to have going in is "able to solve problems by writing software".

jobs@latacora.com
Full-time only. Remote fine, but must be in the US.

University of Michigan | Ann Arbor, MI | Full-Time | Onsite | $52-$68khttp://careers.umich.edu/job_detail/176986/research_support_programmer_intermediateassociate
 My team is hiring a junior/intermediate Research Support Programmer. We are setup as an internal consulting service for the college of LSA that takes any programming job a research lab needs help with. If you think of yourself as a “web developer” or a “python programmer” then this might not be for you. We are looking for someone ready to learn/write/debug whatever the labs need. In the first few years, this will include working with a lot of new languages and technologies.
We are especially interested in adding someone who has experience/interest in interfacing with research hardware: Imagine a researcher just bought a big micro-fluidics machine and a microscope and needs to automate taking images during an experiment. We would be particularly excited to get a LabVIEW fan.

You can email me with informal questions, but the only way to apply is through the link above at the umich careers site.
Note that this job listing ends soon and my close as early as the 6th

FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA
FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web and mobile devices. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture. If things like Rust, app and framework disassembly, or reverse engineering sound like fun, we’d love to talk.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!
Please submit via our jobs page: https://www.fullstory.com/jobs/

newline (formerly Fullstack.io) | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.newline.co/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.
- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.
- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, Blazor etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Oso | Software Engineer | New York City (NYC) - Onsite | https://www.osohq.com/
Oso (backed by Sequoia) is making backend infrastructure security not terrible for developers and ops. We provide a normalized and consistent interface to core security controls, like authentication and encryption, and we do so in a way that’s invisible to developers and simple for ops. To get from alpha to a production-ready v1, we need a small number of sharp engineers who want to get involved on the ground floor and who have some combination of experience in and appetite for taking on these kinds of problems:

1. Building an elegant experience for a highly technical end-user, e.g., making it easy and intuitive for an ops engineer to get up and running in <5 mins

2. Low-level distributed systems, e.g., building lightweight proxies that manage requests asynchronously and deal with things like caching and network failures

3. Running an on-path production service, e.g., building a scalable and resilient service layer across multiple regions and cloud providers

We are building the product in Rust, which we think is both a good design choice for our use case and a fun choice for the team. The engineers who join now will not only have a disproportionately large impact on the product, but also on the culture and future of the company. Given the importance of these team members and magnitude of their contribution, they will get a meaningful equity position.

Founding team: Graham Neray (early employee and Chief of Staff at MongoDB) and Sam Scott (PhD in Cryptography).
To apply, please email graham@osohq.com.

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (3+ yrs experience) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

I usually post this long thing about why we're a great company to work for and I realized that nothing compared to mission and purpose.

So yeah you can read our accolades and I'll reference them below, but the truth is nothing matters more than why we exist:

We're fighting climate change by building better apps for farmers and the agricultural economy.

If I didn't believe this was one of the most important problems of our generation to help future generations, I wouldn't put so much emphasis on this. If you want a mission you can tell your grandchildren about in hopes of creating a better environment for farmers (and really the whole world), we're working on it right here, right now.

I'd love to hear from you and learn more about how you can work with us. Our stack is JavaScript (React front end, Node back end).

For reference, we're a Unicorn company:

https://www.builtinboston.com/2017/09/26/agtech-startup-indigo-boston-tech-unicorn

We work on the most underhyped sector in startups today (agtech):

http://stateofstartups.firstround.com/2018/#trends-and-takes

CNBC named us the Most Disruptive Company in the world, beating out Flexport, Airbnb, and other companies you've seen here on HN:

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/meet-the-2019-cnbc-disruptor-50-companies.html

And our big climate goal is to use regenerative agriculture to sequester 1 TRILLION tons of carbon from the atmosphere:

Chatroulette.com |DevOps (Kubernetes, AWS), Backend (Scala), Frontend (ReasonML) | Zurich, Zug, Switzerland | SALARY: >130k CHF | ONSITE (no remote) | Swiss or EU member-states passport-holders ONLY
The website was featured on mass media (South Park, major television news etc.). It is a web app built around 2008 by (back-then) 17 years old who wanted to talk to his friends on the internet.

The website hasn't really changed in 10 years but right now we are a small team (including the initial founder) who are rebuilding it from scratch with Scala, ReasonML, AWS and other modern technologies.

Some of the technical challenges are:

Evidation Health | Santa Barbara, SF, San Mateo | Full time and Interns | ONSITE or REMOTE | https://evidation.com/careers/
Evidation runs health studies combining digital data with traditional markers.  In addition we run a "why don't you build some good habits" consumer app.

It's an exciting place to be: we work with companies you've heard of to do research you'll hear of. Additionally the company really does only pursue business opportunities that it thinks lead to better health outcomes, so I don't have to worry (much) about all our data being used for advertising or worse.  There's a strong culture around privacy, security, and only using data as consented.

As listed on the careers page we have openings on all teams and for all offices, but I'm specifically leading a small team of Rails backend engineers in Santa Barbara who work on "bridge" services that talk to 3rd party APIs, primarily for data ingestion. I'd love to talk to someone with 2+ years of backend experience in or interested in relocating to Santa Barbara. The company in general is very remote friendly and I'd consider adding remote to this team for the right candidate, but more likely at this time a remote Rails engineer would fit in best on one of our other Rails backend teams.
I'm happy to field and route general inquiries about other roles and teams, but again especially looking for a Rails engineer who'd enjoy working on critical data ingestion and related services.    jkimmel  at evidation dot com

Stacker lets people build apps without code.

We want to change the way software is built and make it available to everyone. That's a pretty big task, and we've got some pretty exciting problems:

If you're a FRONTEND ENGINEER, come and talk to us about how we're building an app runtime that lets you specify an entire app in a bunch of JSON config and have it run as a real-time single page app.

If you're a PRODUCT MANAGER, get in touch and we can chat about how we're taking the features common across all web apps and turning them into installable modules that work seamlessly together.

If you're a PRODUCT DESIGNER, tell us how you'd go about creating not just one design system, but a design-system system to allow our users to build apps that are beautiful by default, but be customisable to the finest level.

If you like PINA COLADA and getting CAUGHT IN THE RAIN, then get in touch anyway.

Quill.org | Software Engineer | New York, NY | ONSITE
React / Ruby / Rails / Python / Machine Learning

At Quill.org, we’ve created an online learning platform to help middle school students, primarily lower income ones, improve their reading and writing ability. Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.

Some info about Quill.org:

- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers

- We served over 1 million students last year and are continuing to grow.

- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts.

- We’ve been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to name a few.

As a member of our engineering team, you will be directly involved in building tools for students, teachers, and administrators. We are looking for developers who can take features from a user story to production. We are a rapidly-growing team of 15 working in the Financial District of New York City. This is a full-time role on-site, and we cannot sponsor a visa at this time.

United Income from Capital One | FinTech Startup | Full Stack Engineer - Javascript | Onsite in Washington, DC | Full Time We’re hiring! United Income is a fintech startup looking to add engineering talent to our team.
We were recently acquired by Capital One and are operating as an independent subsidiary while having the backing of a Fortune 100 company!

Email us at engineering@unitedincome.com if this describes you.

• Do you care about delivering quality product to your users?

• Is providing maintainable, tested code to your fellow engineers (and future self) important to you?

• Do you have a deep understanding of Javascript and/or Python? Are you interested in the movement to a serverless infrastructure?

• When you encounter a problem that isn't neatly packaged and fully defined, are you passionate about digging into it and refining a solution?

If you can answer yes to these questions, you'll find working here exciting and engaging.

At United Income, we value collaboration. We encourage one another to build phenomenal things, and individually we’re all passionate about doing our best work. You'll be responsible for solving some hard problems in consumer finance. As you tackle these problems head on, you'll work with others across the company to make sure you have all the information you need.

Some of our engineering roles involve cool mathematical modeling.

We are committed to equal opportunity and diverse hiring. Even more important than hiring is supporting our diverse team, and we are dedicated to equitable pay and transparency.
As you know, this industry moves FAST. If you have 15 years of Node.js experience...well we think you’re lying ;) We don't expect you to be familiar with our entire tech stack (buzzwords: Javascript/Python/React/AWS/CI/CD/Git). What’s important is your willingness and ability to learn. We want to see your curiosity and passion for what’s out there.

Ought | https://ought.org | Engineering Team Lead | San Francisco (onsite)
We're a non-profit AI research lab. Our goal is to make machine learning solve tasks where success can’t be reduced to a simple metric. We're working towards a future where ML is as helpful for open-ended questions like “Should I get this medical procedure?” and “What career is right for me” as it is for optimizing ad click-through rates.

The core pillar of our research is Mosaic, an app for decomposing thinking about hard questions into small subtasks. We compositionally build complex thoughts out of simple pieces. We want to get to the point where automated aggregation of individual thoughts leads to something that is more than the sum of the pieces.

Humboldt talked about natural language as a system that "makes infinite use of finite means" -- an infinite number of sentences can be created using a finite number of grammatical rules. As engineering team lead at Ought, you're working on mechanisms that have similar flexible compositionality.

We'll pay a $5,000 referral bonus to whoever refers the person we end up hiring (careers@ought.org, terms: https://bit.ly/2lw3Q8w). Our benefits and compensation package are at market with similar roles in the Bay Area.

O(1) Labs | San Francisco, CA | Product Engineer, Cryptography Engineer, Protocol Engineer | Full Time | Onsite | https://codaprotocol.com
At O(1) Labs, we're building the Coda Protocol, the first cryptocurrency to have a constant-sized blockchain. We use recursive zk-SNARKs to compress historic state in Coda's blockchain so that nodes don't have to store all the data going back to the first transaction. Compare this to Bitcoin or Ethereum whose blockchains already have hundreds of GBs of data, and keep growing.

We're excited about this tech because it allows all the nodes in a network to be full nodes (no SPV's!) and enables applications that can use the entire blockchain embedded in a phone or a browser. We're well funded and backed by some of the top investors in the crypto / blockchain space.

I'm on the product team, and we're looking for product engineers - but you can find all the roles we're hiring for here - https://codaprotocol.com/jobs.html. Our stack is OCaml on the protocol side, and ReasonML + React on the front-end. All of our code is open source - https://github.com/codaprotocol/coda.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | UTC+4 to UTC+8 | REMOTE | $42k-$60k
SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses

More than half of our developers are now remote, and I'd like to continue the trend.

To find out more about us, check our developer blog (https://tech.simplepay.cloud) or about page (https://www.simplepay.co.za/about)

Stack: Our work is back-end-heavy Ruby on Rails and we use PostgreSQL as our data store. We use a bit of Vue.js but believe server-side rendering is still the best default.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby.

Location: UTC+4 to UTC+8 preferred, although we'll also consider candidates in UTC+1 to UTC+3 if they have the right skills and experience.
Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud and include a direct link to an open source contribution you've made, or an issue you've logged, no matter how small.

Secfi | Software engineer(s) | Amsterdam, the Netherlands | EUR 40-80k + equity
Secfi is the pre-wealth advisor for startup employees. Figuring out what to do with your equity-based compensation is complicated and expensive and is therefore ignored and neglected. Secfi makes handling startup equity compensation simple and affordable. We build technology that helps employees make the right decisions for their equity compensation.

For example: one of the most complicated things for employees is figuring out how much taxes they need to pay when exercising their Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options. The tax planning tool inside our dashboard does just that: https://www.secfi.com/#gif-container

An exciting challenge we’re working on next is an exercise planning tool that tells you what you should do with your equity based on your personal.

Things have been going very well here at Secfi, and we’re looking to add 10 more people to our Amsterdam engineering team in 2019. We have a variety of engineering vacancies including frontend, backend Python and full stack JavaScript engineers: https://www.secfi.com/careers

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Lead | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.

Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Milyli,Inc | Chicago, IL | Perm, Onsite, Full-Time |https://milyli.com
Milyli stands for “Make It Like You Like It.” It’s the guiding philosophy behind the custom solutions and innovative applications we build for legal professionals.

We are looking for a Back End Developer to join our services team- https://www.milyli.com/jobs-software-developer

Here is how one of our developers describes the project they are working on: We are currently working on migration projects from other eDiscovery systems into Relativity.  On a project level, it's a lot of understanding the client's current workflow and solutions, and what they can get out of using Relativity instead.  Architecturally, it's identifying all of the component parts of the system that is being used, figuring out what the best way to extract that data is (API calls vs direct SQL queries vs other creative solutions), and mapping that to Relativity structured data.  We built a piece of software called Bridge that allows us to specify data in a specific contract format so that it will be imported into Relativity.  I like that between making new tools for different data sources / scenarios, and maintaining/expanding upon Bridge, there's never a dull moment and I'm always learning new things from my peers.

CampusOptics | Engineer #1 | On-site in Austin, TX | Full-Time
CampusOptics is building the first comprehensive fire safety software platform specifically for higher education. Schools have a high regulatory bar to meet for fire safety compliance, and the consequence of failure can be dire. After a few months of market research, we've put a sales and client services team together with deep higher ed experience, and I'm looking for a software engineer to join me in Austin to build the product.

We want to deliver large amounts of value as quickly as possible, and we’ll use technologies that enable that aim. Out of the gates, that will probably mean relying heavily on Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL and only introducing the complexity of front-end frameworks where they make a meaningful difference. We’ll also be delivering a mobile application with to-be-determined technology choices and tradeoffs.

While you don’t already need to be an expert at all of these, we’ll be collaborating on things like defining our core data model, building the API that powers our mobile application, representing complex policies and fire standards in code, working with geospatial data to assist inspectors in the field, and creating visualizations of the state of fire safety on campus.

In the near-term future, this will be a heavily product-focused role. Over time, this engineer could move into a people-management role (EM, Director of Engineering, etc…) or a technical-leadership (technical lead, software architect) role, so please apply whichever direction you're headed.
Email me at jcody@campusoptics.com if you'd like to learn more or talk about whether there might be a fit.

Dynasty | Engineer | LA / Venice, CA | ONSITE
We are automating jobs, starting with leasing. Our business is growing and we really need you to help expand our bot’s capabilities, consolidate, simplify, and scale.

We have six engineers, and we started in Summer 2017.

Our first product is Lisa, a bot that leases houses and apartments. Our clients now include some of the biggest companies in real estate. Clients hire Lisa as if she were a human employee.

People looking for housing perceive a human leasing agent named Lisa, texting from a nearby area code. Everyone who inquires gets a text back in a minute or so. If there's a question the bot can't answer, it goes to human fallback. (That lets us automate most of the work while still passing the Turing test.)

Speaking for myself, this is one of the most fun and technically challenging projects I’ve worked on.

We offer competitive salary and benefits.

Required: speed, pragmatism, a penchant for simplicity, and a history of shipping.

Nice to have: NLP expertise, Tensorflow experience. Java. React, Flow, GraphQL/Apollo. Node. Open source contributions.

(Any of these are positive but none are required. Tell us a bit about what you're comfortable with & what excites you.)
If you’re interested, please email me! dc@dynasty.com

Our company has been on a rapid growth trajectory and the next year will arguably be our greatest year of growth as we're gearing up to release team accounts, our mobile offering, nail down enterprise contracts, and build native recording integrations into very large workplace SaaS tools (cannot disclose details on this point publicly).

We're a small team (30 people) and are remote-first. Half our team is in SF and the other half is distributed across the US, Canada, Brazil and Europe.

All of the roles above are engineers who will be specializing in one product domain and building them from scratch (with devops being the only exception - we have one awesome devops engineer right now so you would be the second).

If you'd like to find out more about our company and culture, peep this! :-)

If any of this sounds interesting and you want to work with a group of empathetic, hungry and growth-minded individuals, please reach out to me via email.

Travelchime (YC W19) | Designer, Full-Stack Engineer/Developer | San Francisco ONSITE | https://travelchime.com/, https://travelchime.com/blog/jobs
Travelchime is building tools to make leisure travel easier. We're a YC W19 graduate who's looking to hire our second (non-founder) engineer and first designer.

We believe that travel makes us and the world better, and are trying to lower the bar to travel by bringing together all the information you need to travel in the best tool to organize your plans. Our product so far is a Google Docs for planning travel and sharing recommendations.

We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks on a kanban, designing on Figma, and building and shipping continuously. Harry and I have worked at Stripe, McKinsey, and Google and studied Computer Science at Yale. We've built profitable travel businesses in the past, and at Travelchime, we try to take the best parts of each of the our past workplaces and bring them together.

We believe in work-life balance. We work regular hours, take time off as a team to eat lunch together (and even cook!), exercise, and enjoy time with friends and family. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us closer to our friends, and have quarterly travel offsites where the goal is to just enjoy visiting a new place and use the tools we’ve built.
If you enjoy travel, and would love to make it easier for the rest of the world to do it, send us a note at founders@travelchime.com! We’d love for you to join our team.

Programming Trainer | Seattle + SF + Other cities | https://www.developintelligence.com
DevelopIntelligence gives hands-on training courses (generally 3-4 days each at client sites) to software developer teams (generally mid-level and senior devs) at companies like Intuit, Starbucks, and Salesforce. The courses are generally 40% lecture, 40% labs/coding, and 20% Q&A.

Because we've been growing, we need to find more developers/trainers to come teach for us. We really need a lot of help in front-end, devops, ML, golang and cloud (among several other areas...).

We need to find developers who have a couple things (this can be be challenging): 1) Have the time/interest to teach and have taught professionally before 2) Can build their own labs/slides for their course 3) Have 5-10+ years of experience and can answer fairly difficult questions from experienced developers 4) Can make a class fun and engaging.

Our day rate is $1500.

Unnamed Seed Stage Startup | Founding Engineer OR Founding Design/Product Role | Remote and Bay Area | Full Time
We are a new startup in the UX design tool space, with a mission to radically lower the barriers needed to build full-fidelity prototypes and products—something currently accessible only to a tiny and privileged sub-population (developers).  The stage is very early, pre-product, but we have enthusiastic early feedback.

The team of four has three ex-founders.  We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.

We received strong (outlier) funding offers from a number of top tier VCs.  We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of amazing angels/funds, including leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer.  No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.
If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com.  Thanks, we're excited to hear from you!

White Swan Data | Central London, UK | https://whiteswandata.com | ONSITE
White Swan Data is a betting data analytics company.  We are very new in our current form (1 page website!) but have around 20 quants/data scientists/developers working on sophisticated systems to maximize our client's betting returns.  We are small, the metrics are simple and we are just starting a rapid expansion of our development team.

We're seeking independently minded developers who don't need to be told twice what to work on and who will circle back for clarification only once they have got their story straight on what they do know. The company is small and you will be working face to face with very clever product owners who will provide a tight feedback loop for your code, your ideas and your efforts.

* Mid/Senior level developers in Python, Java or Kotlin.

Exposure to SQL DBs, scientific programming, data gathering, data analysis and networking code a plus.  For Python specifically: pandas, numpy, trio, requests, beautiful soup etc.  Kotlin because we love it.

The people we hire will have a big say in our future tech stack, the architecture of our platform, in fact, anything really where they can demonstrate both knowledge and maturity of understanding.  We are a small, smart, data science heavy organization looking to quickly grow a team of excellent developers to write both model and operational code - so it's a real opportunity to get in on the ground floor and maximize leverage of your skills.
In the first instance please message me directly (email in profile) with just a single paragraph on your education, your work experience, your keys skills and an answer to the question: "I don't need to be told twice because...?"

Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/ Positions: Full-Stack Engineer, Data Scientists, R&D Product Formulator / Scientist
Overview: Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception of flavor, aroma, and texture to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products, enter new markets, and optimize their existing brands. We're a diverse 12 person post Series-A company.

Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, Java, GraphQL, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS

The Position(s)

_Data Science_: We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. Our Data Science team develops new models and algorithms from scratch to make second-order inference on sparse data sets from non-representative samples that generalizes to the underlying target population. We rely on cutting edge models such as persistent homology, PU Learning, and metric learning to make predictions on non-eucldian human sensory data. We don't use tensor flow or pandas or keras as they are not a good fit for our problem space. We prefer a deep understanding of math and stats VS experience running logistic regressions in Python. (but we're cool with Python / Logit / experience)

_Engineering_: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Data-Engineers with experiance in micro-batch processing for machine learning pipelines.
Next Steps: please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

- AI/Machine Learning

- Content and Digital Marketing

- Industrial, Electrical, Manufacturing, Health & Safety, Firmware, and Quality Engineering

- Executive Assistants

- Marketing Analytics

- Supply Chain

- Finance

- Project Management

Speaking Chinese or knowing how to deal with asian culture is a huge plus. We typically do not sponsor visas.

Foxconn is the largest electronic manufacturing company in the world and is rapidly growing in Wisconsin. With a focus on Industrial AI and a mission to create an intelligent data ecosystem, as an employee at Foxconn you would be working with cutting edge technology in a fast-paced and international environment.

Specifically for HN: We are looking for AI talent in vision, NLP, text to speech, and industrial prediction. For technology, we are mostly doing tensorflow in python3, but are open to whatever you're productive in. When people in interviews ask us what our company culture is like, we'll call ourselves "the world's best-funded startup." But it's not hyperbole -- There's a lot of room for people with big ideas that can leverage our data to make money with world's largest electronics manufacturing company.

We might not be a silicon valley startup, but we are the 5th largest private company in term of employees and the largest tech employer in the world. We probably manufacture the GPU you use for training, the network switch your TCP packets move through, or the cloud server you ssh into.

Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k
https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Vetspire | Full Stack Software Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time | https://vetspire.com
Vetspire is an AI-driven veterinary medical records and practice management platform. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.

We're looking for a couple full stack engineers to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. To do this, you’ll be working at every stage of patient care from the exam room to back-end analytics. Some examples of what your weeks may look like: creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time, designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders, or building a secure messaging platform for client and doctor communications.

You'll be working directly with the vets using Vetspire, and talking with them almost every day to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It's an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone's pets.

Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix/Absinthe application written in Elixir, our front end is a React SPA using the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.
Apply here: https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/vetspirecom/view/P_AAAAAAHAABwLgCs6TZavhH (Write "HN" in "How did you hear about us?")

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React & React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and increasingly Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

You’ll work with a small but mighty team to create great online experiences as we create new, and enhance existing rider facing and dealer facing platforms.

We can offer you great benefits that include 100% paid health, dental and vision insurance, 401K matching, monthly employee events and major discounts on bikes and bike gear. Those parts come with the industry. We can offer you a relaxed working environment, local singletrack, and the opportunity to work with a group of bike enthusiasts in a great place to live. Those parts come with the territory.

But what we really want is what you have to offer us. We want to attract job seekers that are looking for a brand that they can be an integral part of, and not just "a company to work for". It's the individual personalities, and the raw enthusiasm for the brand that makes this place special, and that comes directly from the employees of Santa Cruz Bicycles.

Since we are a small team you’ll need to wear many hats. You will need to have great design skills, the development skills to translate design to production code, and the pragmatism to prioritize getting things done vs pixel perfectness. You’ll be part of the team responsible for selecting and building the technologies to help us deliver the future of road and mountain biking for two of the world’s most respected cycling brands.

Requirements: HTML, CSS, JS, and 1 year of professional development experience. React is a nice bonus.

Astranis (YC W16) | San Francisco, CA | Full-Time | Onsite | US Citizen or Green Card
Four billion people do not have access to the internet. Astranis is going to change that. We are building the next generation of smaller, lower-cost telecommunications satellites to bring the world online.

Come work with incredibly smart people who have flown things in space before. No prior space experience needed, you just need to enjoy getting your hands dirty with real hardware and be okay with struggling to do things that seem impossibly hard.

We’re a well-funded team of over 60 world-class engineers that moves fast. We raised our Series A from Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator in 2017, launched our first satellite in 2018, secured our first client in 2019, and we’ll triple the satellite internet capacity of Alaska in 2020.
Check out our postings here -- https://jobs.lever.co/astranis.
Roles we’re hiring for include:
* Power electronics -- design ~2 kW satellite power systems, including solar arrays and electronics for power regulation and distribution

* Thermal -- design and analyze systems to reject sizable point loads without the aid of convection

* Embedded software -- write mission-critical software that runs the spacecraft. No previous embedded or space experience required.

* Avionics -- PCB design, layout, bringup, test of electrical subsystems. Bonus: experience with fault-tolerant electronics

* Aerospace/controls -- implement solutions to 6 DOF, non-linear control problems. Experience with spacecraft controls is a plus but not required

* RF/Microwave -- work across a broad range designing and implementing RF systems at microwave frequencies, including LNAs and power amplifiers

* DSP/FPGA -- program FPGA hardware, develop custom DSP IP cores and integrate off-the-shelf IP cores
* Operations -- identify and complete cross-functional strategic projects that span recruiting, onboarding, culture, finance, marketing, legal/regulatory, vendor management, and far more

Argo AI | Senior data analyst, software engineers, hardware engineers | Pittsburgh, PA, Palo Alto, CA | full time | onsite
Argo AI was founded to tackle one of the most challenging applications in computer science, robotics and artificial intelligence with self-driving vehicles. Argo AI is developing and deploying the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision to help build safe and efficient self-driving vehicles that enable these transformations and more. The challenges are significant, but we are a team that believes in tackling hard, meaningful problems to improve the world.
We are building a high-performance team that is excited by complex engineering challenges and is passionate about making transportation safer, more affordable and accessible for all.

We're hiring for engineering positions (hardware, software, mechanical, electrical, computer engineering) and non technical roles (finance, project management, operations).

I'm responsible for our analytics department, and we're looking for senior data analysts who are interested in making the world better and safer with self driving cars. The analytics department at Argo is pretty new, so you'll have a large impact. We're expecting you to know SQL, as well as Python or R (or another language used for data analysis).

You'll get to interact with many smart people, and our water cooler discussions are around lidars, geometry, mapping, machine learning, computer vision, and how people drive differently in different parts of the US, instead of click through rate maximization. We're well funded, our management and leadership is great, and in my personal opinion, a great place to work at.

Prometheus Research | DevOps Team Lead | New Haven, CT | Full Time | REMOTE | https://prometheusresearch.com/
We are searching for a development operations team leader to continue our transition to the cloud. This is a remote position with eastern timezone working hours, but we need a US Citizen or permanent resident.

Prometheus Research builds and maintains clinical patient registries for health care associations and medical research institutions. Over the past year, we've been updating our solution delivery systems to use Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform and GCP. Our application platform is containerized and uses PostgreSQL, Python, Nginx, and other tools.  Working knowledge about OWASP, OAuth, Linux, VPNs, Firewalls, Logging, Monitoring, and other traditional system administration technologies and skills are essential to this role. We are also in a heavily regulated industry; specific domain knowledge includes: HIPAA, HITECH, FedOnRamp, and others.

This team lead position is a full-time, fully remote position (little travel) with fully remote team members. Thus, it's important to have excellent written communication and know how to use Markdown, diagramming tools, give presentations, and make training videos. We expect about 1d/week of administrative duties, including managing (via O3s) a team of 2-3 system administrators and developers. Your peers will be leading engineering and solution development teams.

Prometheus doesn't have a single SaaS, instead, it has custom solutions for each of our clients. Hence, this position has a different flavor from other roles. We are seeking to transition from a centralized release team to one where each customer solution development team is responsible for their own releases. Our ideal candidate will see themselves as a tool builder, educator, and engineer that is building repeatable processes that client services teams could use.

If this sounds like something you're interested in, please drop me an email, devops-20190903-group@prometheusresearch.com, thanks!
P.S. We are also looking for a senior software engineer. For this, you could see the posting at https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Prometheus-Research/

Magic | Full Remote Job | Full-time | Full-stack | Software Engineering
ABOUT THE COMPANY:

Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.

ABOUT THE POSITION:

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

ABOUT WORKING REMOTE:

This position is full remote and you can live wherever you want, or travel while you work with us. As our team is distributed across many time zones, compatibility with both UTC-7/8 and UTC+8 is helpful and willingness to participate in team meetings at non-standard times (such as early morning or evening) for an est. 5-10 hours per week is ideal.

Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.

Bonus points if you've got...
- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins
- Experience within early-stage startups, remote, or human operations companiesApply here: https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hnr

VP of Engineering | REMOTE (EUROPEAN TIME ZONES) | STARTUP | FULL-TIME
If you have a soft spot for bootstrapped, profitable companies with a meaningful product, and you would like to develop a small, super-capable technical team in a refreshing work environment, you might quite like this extremely rare executive position at Drops.

WHOM WE'RE AFTER:

You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.

You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.

You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.

You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).

You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.

You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture - organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.

We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.

You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.

WHAT'D BE DIFFERENT HERE:

We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.

We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.

We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.

We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit.

We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.

We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.
We automate where it has positive ROI.
Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.
We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.

Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.

REQUIREMENTS

Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.

You have excellent technical and people skills. (yes, we know, it’s rare!)

You are more of a frontend than a backend engineer. (we’re frontend heavy)

You held senior software engineering management position such as CTO, Head of Development, or VP of Engineering positions in the past and enjoyed it.

You have introspective tendencies, and you’re looking for a position where you can grow fast.
You can represent the technology, infrastructure, and the engineering team at the executive level.

Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

Parse.ly is trusted by over 400 enterprises, used by over 4,000 high-traffic websites, and has tens of thousands of active user seats for its core analytics product.

We are an established, but quickly-growing, company with a 20+ person product team and millions of dollars in revenue.

Our beautiful dashboards visualize data flowing from over 1 billion monthly unique devices. You can see a recent example of a fun data visualization product we made from this data at https://currents.parsely.com. (Make sure you are not using an ad-blocker when checking it out.)

The mission of our lean & fully distributed team is described here:

https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73

As a frontend engineer, you'll join the small sub-team that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s customer-facing SaaS dashboard. You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to customers -- working in JavaScript/ES, HTML5, CSS3, Python3, and some other great technologies.

For this role, you’ll need to be strong in JavaScript; have a keen sense of good design; have experience with web/mobile frameworks; and enjoy D3.js.

For bonus points, you'd develop some comfort level implementing native iOS or Android applications.

In short, we're looking for people who enjoy crafting beautiful user experiences & products, and who also enjoy shipping to customers regularly.

You need to be technical enough to do real Python/Django programming for our middle tier HTTP/JSON service; to do real D3.js visualizations by hand in JavaScript; to navigate JS frameworks like AngularJS & ReactJS, including 10,000+ LOC codebases; to evaluate open source projects pragmatically; and to develop some experience with native mobile development.

Join us to build the world's best content analytics dashboard. Apply at work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/code you think is relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile.
Make sure to mention HN and the "Frontend Engineer" role. Also, please list your years of frontend engineering experience, current timezone/location, and daily working hours (e.g. 10am-6pm ET). Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US_Eastern, US_Central, and US_Mountain timezones, due to our current team working hours.

https://www.nexient.com/careers/apply

----- My description -----

(I'm a Sysadmin / DevOps person, I'm not HR or recruitment, but my posting here has been approved by the recruiting dept. I wouldn't post this if I thought this wasn't an actually great company to work for!)

Nexient are good people: My experience at Nexient has been overwhelmingly positive, they are flexible, caring and fun to work at. They actually care about the life/work balance too. Multiple tabletop, D&D, console gaming nights are organized all the time. Charity drives and other ways to give are also promoted within the company. The work environment is really nice too, with motorized standing/sitting desks and laptops that actually have enough memory!! Nexient do outsourcing but with US-based staff, we work closely with clients so we're just part of the team.

Nexient are also working hard to add hundreds of tech jobs in Michigan and Ohio. There's a real need for good folks to help us help our clients.

----- Recruiting Dept's Description -----

Nexient is hiring! In 2009, we launched Nexient to give American businesses a more responsive, domestic alternative to sending software development offshore. We knew we could deliver better software faster by collaborating with clients in real time. Today, we’re the only 100% US tech company among the World’s Top 100 Outsourcers. Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.

We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks. The list of current openings is available at https://www.nexient.com/careers. These are full time positions working from Nexient’s delivery center at Ann Arbor, MI. Visa sponsorship and telecommute / remote work options are not available for these roles.

----- TO APPLY -----

To apply, please use either my email address, aclark@nexient.com OR https://www.nexient.com/careers and mention my email address and name, Anthony Clark.
I could potentially get a bonus if you are hired, just want to fully disclose that I could personally benefit from your actions.

Beacon Biosignals | Lead Front-End Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
About us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.

About you:

- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.

- You believe that honesty and frequent, open communication are more signficant contributors to software development than technical wizardy.

- You believe that "looks great" does not necessarily equal "feels great", and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).

- You want to build tools that help people help others in critical environments.

- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between "DRY" as an important guiding principle of software development, and "DRY" as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.

- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.

- You nerd out about content-specific adaptive streaming and compression techniques.

- You think Observable notebooks are really cool.

- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.

- From a front-end perspective, you recognize the tension in the development feedback loop between client-side software and a back-end service ecosystem, and derive immense satisfaction from improving development processes to relieve those tensions.

- You're intimately familiar with the lifecycle of software components - from experiment, to prototype, to an incremental release schedule.

- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.

Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language, and are still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack. Come help us make the right decisions!

Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.
P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!

Squarespace | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Onsite |  New York City (West Village area)Apply here! 
https://www.squarespace.com/careers/jobs/77247
The Squarespace Machine Learning team is growing! We source projects from all over the company, ranging from direct integrations of NLP & computer vision into our products to behind-the-scenes services that improve efficiency in our customer help center. Our team prizes stakeholder-focused development of research and project deliverables while also taking time out for reading groups, conference attendance and Hack Week projects that pursue educational and research goals.

The ML team uses a Python-focused development stack with all the usual ML and data processing libraries. We have a framework for rapidly deploying our models behind lightweight Flask web applications in a managed Kubernetes environment and to thrive in our team you should enjoy the full range of backend engineering tasks that go along with this. You won't be developing ML models in isolation, but instead demonstrating leadership and ownership over deployment strategies, architecture choices to solve cold-start problems, defining observability and monitoring strategies and working with stakeholders to define validation metrics that don't merely represent statistical considerations like overfitting or precision & recall but go further to develop holistic understanding of model success in a broader product development context.

We are seeking a senior machine learning engineer with a highly developed skill set in software engineering, architectural design and experience mentoring junior engineers and collaborating with multiple stakeholders to deliver projects. You should be skilled in the application of machine learning both on the statistics side and the backend engineering side and comfortable moving between the two sets of responsibilities as the situation demands. We welcome applicants with experience in any variety of machine learning or applied statistics context (e.g. quant finance, time series analysis, audio processing, etc.), though the candidate should show an enthusiasm for information retrieval, search and recommendation, and computer vision models because these are at the forefront of what we do.

Squarespace offers highly competitive compensation and exceptional benefits & work life balance. In this role you can also expect a high degree of autonomy to help lead choices in ML technology investment and data set curation to set up Squarespace for future success. If this challenge sounds interesting to you, we'd love to hear from you so please apply! Feel free to use the cover letter space to let us know you found us via Hacker News!

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because rest is important).

Locale.ai | Bangalore, IN| Backend Software Engineer | Fulltime | ONSITE
We are an early-stage GIS startup based out of Bangalore. Our vision is to help companies make better real-time business decisions and solve some of their complex spatial problems at scale!

As a software engineer at an early stage startup, you will be responsible for laying the foundation of all engineering systems. Your day might begin with designing a new micro-service supposed to handle 500 million pings on its first day in production and end with fierce debates on coding guidelines or the best practices for handling data consistency across distributed systems.

Being an enterprise-focused company, our systems don't scale linearly or even exponentially. Every new customer brings the scale of millions of customers that they serve. We need to build robust, scale-ready and fault-tolerant services from day one. Our clients rely on it.

If you are looking to spend your 20s learning how to build a company from scratch, if building systems at scale excites you, if you are mesmerized by what the world of location can offer or if you are passionate about zero-to-one, we will see you on the other side? :)
You can apply here: locale.freshteam.com/jobs
