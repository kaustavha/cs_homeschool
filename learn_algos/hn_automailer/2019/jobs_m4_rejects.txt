PathAI | Boston, MA or Austin, TX | https://pathai.com | Onsite / Remote (US)
PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to help detect cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.
Check out our open positions at https://www.pathai.com/careers/.

Microsoft | Boulder, CO | Senior Software Engineer | ONSITE (can frequently work from home) | Full Time
Microsoft is looking for a Senior Software Engineer in Boulder, CO for its Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team.

This is a role where you will work with a wide range of technologies and languages, developing cloud solutions side-by-side with software engineers outside of Microsoft. We are looking for a senior engineer who has a strong background in cloud architecture, a history of mentoring junior engineers, and strong software engineering skills. The role does involve traveling to customer locations roughly twice every three months (flying in on a Monday and out on a Friday) - all travel is planned well in advance.

This isn't a consulting role - there are no billable hours, we work side-by-side with external engineers building projects with them, not for them. Project schedules are determined collectively by both parties and we ensure we don't burn engineers out (work-life balance is a high priority). This role doesn't involve any on-call responsibilities during or after a customer project.

Our long term goal is to become a one-stop solution to assist drivers with their automotive related challenges. This includes helping drivers finding the best price on auto insurance, leasing & financing options, mechanics etc. We've bootstrapped the company and have dismissed over $10 million worth of fines.
Our team: We are a small development team with members who take on multiple roles across the stack. We strive to always be improving our process and code bases, to use the correct tools for the tasks at hand, and to help grow our collective skills.
Your Role: We’re looking for a full-stack engineer driven to solve challenging problems with a clean and maintainable approach. You will write modular, high-quality code while actively contributing to peer code reviews. You are an intelligent, passionate, and innovative developer that can formulate new ideas and execute them within an existing development environment. Ideally, you enjoy a hands on approach in determining how you and the team can develop technology to meet the company’s business needs.

Skills: We’re seeking developers with full stack skills and experience. Our primary web application is written in Angular, however, we consider ourselves to be a React team. We’re developing new projects in React, and are actively transitioning our web app to React as well. We use Node.js on the backend, with MongoDB as the datastore for our primary products. We appreciate developers with an array of backend skills, but experience using Node in a backend environment is a must. Mobile experience is a plus, but we are not hiring strictly mobile devs at this time. Our applications are native Android and iOS applications, written in Java and Swift/ObjC respectively.
Experience: Ideally you have previous startup experience, writing production level code, or experience deploying your own projects to a userbase.

- good Node, React, Rails, WordPress, and enterprise Azure e-commerce developers, as well as excellent technical project managers. We prefer people with a reasonable amount of experience under their belt, but there are always exceptions.

- a couple of excellent, principal-level, general-specialist software engineers who are comfortable leading tech teams, identifying and solving clients' real (as opposed to reported) problems, architecting solutions from scratch, refactoring existing codebases, putting out occasional fires, and moving fairly seamlessly from one project / language / framework to another.
We do web and app (and occasionally some blockchain) development for a panoply of clients ranging from Fortune 500 to brand-new startups -- right now the distribution is roughly 50-50 -- and we pay well.

This is my third startup and I've spent significant time at larger companies like Google and Facebook so while there's a good chance we will fail (hey it's a startup), you'll be treated fairly and respectfully and will have kind, smart, and accomplished coworkers. We also have family so understand how to work hard while being present parents and we value that. This is going to be more of a marathon than a sprint.

ReadCoor | Hardware Software Engineer and Pipeline Software Engineer | Cambridge, MA | ONSITE, REMOTE | https://www.readcoor.com
ReadCoor is a company developing a platform for DNA sequencing in 3D tissue.  We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, chemists, hardware and software engineers building this technology to assist in the next leap of biological research and discovery.

Why 3D Spatial Sequencing?

Current state of the art DNA sequencing will tell you what raw "source code" you have. Various RNA sequencing technologies and recent single cell techniques will give you "runtime configuration" information.  These techniques will tell you what molecules are present in a tissue, but they do not tell you where the molecules are located.

Our sequencing technology maps their location in exquisite detail. We can, for example tell you not just that a virus’s DNA was found in a sample, but also allow you to view the intact tissue and see which individual cells were infected. We apply this technology to all areas of biomedical research including infectious disease, neuroscience, and cancer biology.

Pipeline Software Engineer

Our backend pipeline engineering role is responsible for building and scaling out our ingestion and processing pipeline.

This pipeline uses a lot of python (numpy, scipy, skimage, pandas, dask, zarr to name a few libraries) to process individual tissue samples which range in size from 1-5 TB of images (and growing).

Hardware Software Engineer

Our Hardware Software Engineer is responsible for writing code that enables our automated sequencing platform.

To accomplish this we use python, C++, and JS to control a complex mutli-axis imaging platform with integrated high-precision fluidics.
If interested, please visit https://www.readcoor.com/job-openings to see the Pipeline and Hardware positions.

DocStation is a platform that makes it easy for pharmacists to transition away from dispensing pills to providing clinical care for patients. We built the platform with their workflow in mind as opposed to billing requirements, which plagues most of the industry/market. We’re also in a unique position because the majority of the tech innovation has happened at the Hospital/Health System level while pharmacy has been left in the stone age; which is a huge market opportunity as pharmacy starts to catch up.

We receive data from insurance claims on a daily, weekly, monthly cadence that we transform into patient profiles, medication lists, and insights in the UI in order to augment the clinical work of pharmacists to give them time back in their day. We have lots of data at our fingertips and we need your help presenting it to pharmacists so they can take even better care of their patients.

Within our team, no one throws tasks or responsibilities over a wall. The phrase, “That’s not my job”, doesn’t exist here. We understand that DevOps is everyone’s job. We support one another and don’t point fingers of blame.
If this resonates with you, and sounds like an environment you’d like to be a part of, please consider taking a look at our job posting: https://ucla.in/2IGcURR

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:
- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

<Confidential - Energy Sector> | Software / ML Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time
We are a small, profitable, bootstrapped company that applies machine learning (ML) to fluid dynamics (FD) systems.

We are looking for an engineer to work closely with the founder and form the core of our team.

Role

* The FD models are developed by a specialized ML team; they’re evaluated in a simulated environment, where a second ML layer decides agent action based on FD model output.

* Everything except development of the FD models is under the purview of this role.  (You’re absolutely welcome to dive into that; it’s just not a requirement.)

* Minimal bureaucracy: we're a tiny team with existing customers.  We don't have outside investors to persuade.  There's very little friction in going from idea to production.

Responsibilities

* Build data pipelines to request, transform and store data.  (This is a small component of the role.)

* Build (statistical / machine-learned) agent actions based on FD model outputs.

* Develop an event-driven simulation environment to evaluate FD and agent models.

* Work closely with FD team to iterate on FD model based on simulation performance.

* Deploy pipelines and trained FD and agent models into production.  Capture events and model inference.

Skills

* Extensive experience (ideally using Python) to build high-availability, complex systems.

* Intimate familiarity with the Python scientific data stack.

* Experience with "classical" machine learning, such as tree-based models and Bayesian methods.

* Nice-to-have: math or physics background.
We prefer remote candidates in the US or Canada, but would consider those in the UK and the EU.  Write us at confidential.energy@gmail.com.

Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineers; Product Managers; Data Scientists | San Francisco, CA | Onsite
Academia.edu is a distribution and peer review platform for academic research. The Academia.edu platform addresses two problems:

- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic paper ever written on the internet, available for free.

- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.

It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.

With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 20 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 60 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.

With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community.

Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company has a freemium business model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."
We are looking to hire full stack software engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

Crux Informatics | Infrastructure Engineer | San Francisco (SF) or New York (NYC) | ONSITE | https://jobs.lever.co/cruxinformatics
The Crux Infrastructure team’s mission is to provide infrastructure products that enable Engineering to work efficiently, run reliable services, and remain secure. We build products designed to be used by our fellow engineers. These products can be anything from amazing development environments, to seamless continuous delivery services, to simple out-of-the-box service monitoring, to core compute infrastructure that just works.

You might like this role if you:

- Enjoy writing Python and/or Go (golang), and can write high quality code

- Sweat the details, while focusing on impact

- Aim higher, while keeping it simple

- Hear about a proposed design and immediately start thinking about the end-to-end workflow, edge cases, failure modes, and security risks

- Are excited about building internal products that make your fellow engineers happier and more productive, and our services more reliable and secure

- Think observability is critical to running reliable services

- Love the idea of unleashing a simian army to wreak havoc on systems

- Get satisfaction from helping others

- Can geek-out about Linux to the point that those around you think you are weird

We don’t expect a single candidate to be an expert in all areas, but if some of these ring true to you, you might like this role.

The company:

With Crux, companies can harness data without the high costs. Our data engineers deliver action-ready data to businesses via our cloud platform. By delivering action-ready data through the cloud, we dramatically reduce the need for companies to build infrastructure to manage and process data. We also eliminate the burdensome tasks which eat up 80% of data teams’ time and energy—wrangling data to prepare it for analysis. We help people devote their time and energy at work to finding insights and creating returns—the work that’s truly valuable.

Raytheon CWMI | USA (multiple locations) | Full Time | On Site
I'm an engineer with Raytheon's Cyber Warfare Mission Innovations (CWMI) and wanted to reach out to the hackernews community and let you guys know what we're looking for. All comments here are mine and mine alone and not endorsed by Raytheon proper. Any questions leave them here (preferably so others can benefit) or PM me. I'll answer them if I can.
For more information feel free to message me at needsmoarcyber@gmail.com
or visit https://www.raytheon.com/cyber .
We're looking for people who want to break things and have fun doing it. We're looking for developers, hackers, researchers, and engineers with an interest in information security and low level development. We take our work and our fun seriously. We refuse any work that isn’t hard and engaging. We make sure our engineers have the tools they need to do their jobs, and focus on recognizing results.

Key areas of focus include:
• Reverse Enginering
• Vulnerability Research
• Wireless and Network Communications
• Hypervisors
• Malware
• Mobile/Embedded Development
• Win32/Linux Kernel development
• Constraint Solving
• Exploit mitigation techniques
Basically, if it’s in the cyber (yes we said it) realm, we’re doing something cool with it.

Familiarity with at least one common low-level architecture (x86, ARM, etc) is important, as is the ability to conduct vulnerability research against applications compiled for that architecture. Experience with software protection and binary armoring is a plus, and familiarity with modern exploit mitigation techniques and counter-measures is a must.

Aside from reverse engineers and researchers, we are also looking for developers with an interest in low level systems development. If you're comfortable living in the kernel, developing emulators, or similar kinds of work, we'd love to hear from you! C and C++ skills are definitely a plus.

US Citizenship & the ability to obtain a Top Secret clearance is required. If you're already cleared, even better!
Our headquarters is in Indialantic, FL with offices in Annapolis Junction, MD; Ballston, VA; Dulles, VA; San Antonio TX; Austin, TX; Augusta, GA; Huntsville, AL; and Greenville, SC. Relocation assistance is available.

In addition to gaining deep experience with developing systems at scale, you'll work with a world-class data science team (winners of multiple KDD Best Paper and other awards) that keeps us on the cutting edge of machine learning research. You'll gain direct exposure to the ins and outs of the rapidly growing and evolving adtech industry.

We place a high value on maintaining a good work-life balance, avoiding grinds and focusing on getting things done rather than putting in long hours. A bunch of us play ultimate frisbee or soccer on Fridays, and we have regular dev seminars and lunch-and-learns to talk tech and learn from each other.

Required Technical Skills:

* 4+ Years of professional experience in Java.

* Experience building and owning, high volume, high availability distributed systems

* Knowledge of building and consuming RESTful services

* Experience with SQL and relational database design
* Write high-quality code using modern best practices
One or more of the following is considered a huge plus:
* Previous adtech or martech industry experience

* You’ve worked with: Kafka, Cassandra, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, or similar technologies

* Experience developing ETL pipelines.

* Experience with Javascript frameworks/HTML/CSS

* Knowledge of Machine Learning, Distributed Systems or Big Data.

* Exposure to CI / CD (with either Docker, Kubernetes, SaltStack or Jenkins)

Peakon | Senior Backend Engineers | Mobile Engineer (Android) | Engineering Manager | Data Scientist | Manual QA Engineer | ONSITE Copenhagen, DK
Peakon is the world's leading platform for measuring and improving Employee Engagement. We started Peakon to help companies around the world build better workplaces. We are a data company - not just a survey company - and this allows us to provide insights that will transform businesses.

As part of our company goals for 2019, we are scaling our Engineering and Product team and are currently looking for multiple roles:

* Multiple Senior Backend Engineers (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/941871)

* Android Mobile Engineer (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/726306)

* Frontend Engineering Manager (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/741160)

* Data Scientist (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/914473)

* QA Engineer (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/947182)

Our tech stack of Peakon centres around Javascript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain across the stack, enabling engineers to work on all parts of the system. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are big fans of new JavaScript language features like async/await, and have made it a priority to stay up to date with the latest versions of Node. We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with an increasing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.
Trust and transparency guide everything we do. At Peakon you’ll find a transparent salary model, unlimited vacation, minimal hierarchy, and maximum freedom to develop and execute your own ideas. Our style of collaboration is based on honesty and friendship, and we always love making new friends!

Trade Me | Senior Android Developer | Full-time | ONSITE | VISA | Wellington, New Zealand |
Trade Me is an online used and new goods marketplace. It's like the New Zealand version of eBay or Amazon. Our Android app is one of the most popular apps in NZ, updated fortnightly with hundreds of thousands of daily users.

The role is based in Wellington, the "coolest little capital in the world." See the promotional website: https://www.wellingtonnz.com/discover/

Wellington is a small city with a big heart. There is a strong coffee culture and some of NZ's most beautiful scenery is nearby.

All our new code is in Kotlin and we use MVI for our new features. We use Android architecture components and dagger-android.

There are lots of opportunities for growth in the company and interaction with more than ten other Android developers in a guild.

Autonomy is important for us so in our squad you will get a chance to have your say in the direction of the products we develop. There is also the leisure to refactor and work on open source if you so desire. Limited work from home may be a possibility in the future but you would have to be based in Wellington.
I'm active on Stack Overflow so please check out my questions and answers to see if you agree with some of my philosophy ;-) 
https://stackoverflow.com/users/5241933/david-rawson
Would love to hear from senior devs who are amicable, interested in software architecture and design patterns, like to mentor junior devs, and want to work to raise engineering standards.

We can help with visas for the right candidate.

commercetools | Software Engineer - Scala | On-Site | Full-Time | Berlin, Germany | https://commercetools.com/careers
We combine solving hard tech challenges you’d expect in a Silicon Valley startup with German work/life balance.

Our Backend-as-a-Service powers commerce in a wide range of industries, including automotive, robotics, gaming, on-demand printing, fashion and toys. We don’t run mom-and-pop stores - we excel for enterprise customers that need a commerce platform that is both customizable and yet highly scalable and reliable.

Some of the challenges you can help us with:

* Scaling a multi-tenant BaaS with heterogeneous traffic patterns. We continuously improve the performance of our code (written in Scala) as well as our persistence layer (MongoDB and ElasticSearch).

* Rework our data models where they aren’t suitable for our biggest enterprise customers. E.g. we need to support retailers with inventory across hundreds of stores.

* Multi-cloud, multi-region deployment: We offer our customers a choice between different cloud providers (including AWS and GCP) and regions.

* Adopt new technologies in our developer-facing products. E.g. we invest in GraphQL and CloudEvents, and participate in specification processes as well as Open Source projects.

We’re 150 people from 35 countries. We offer flexible work hours, home office and are parent friendly. I myself leave the office at 3:30pm three times a week to spend the afternoon with my son, and then spent another 2 hours working at home in the evening.
For the Scala job in our team see: https://commercetools-jobs.personio.de/job/41580?language=en... Feel free to message me if you have any questions at christoph DOT neijenhuis AT companyname DOT com (No recruiters, no agencies please.)

GE Aviation | Software & Data Engineers | Full-time | Cincinnati, Detroit, Cheltenham | ONSITE
GE Aviation's cybersecurity team is hiring for a large number of software and data engineering positions. If you've taken a flight recently, odds are good that it was powered by a GE Aviation aircraft engine - our business continues to show strong growth, and a key enabler of that growth is the security team that keeps our employees and data safe. We're a relatively small team in a big business, with a challenging mission to solve security problems at scale (and ample autonomy and resources to do so). Our team is product-oriented, with a focus on building tools that help our analysts respond to threats and help our users protect their data.

We're looking for developers who are independent, curious, and comfortable working on both established and greenfield products. If you're someone who likes to take ownership of ideas from whiteboard to production, you'll find there's tons of opportunity to do so here.

Prior experience in cybersecurity is not required, but some interest in it is encouraged. Don't be scared off by the job postings - if you're ambitious and enthusiastic, we want to talk to you.

Transcriptic (YC W15) | Scientific Software engineers, Backend Engineers | Menlo Park, CA | https://transcriptic.com | FULL TIME; ONSITE
Transcriptic is creating a fully automated, integrated, and programmatically controlled science lab to change how science is performed and turn science execution into an information technology. Scientists anywhere can define and (reproducibly!) run experiments over the internet on-demand and without investing up-front in a lab facility.

The Transcriptic Common Lab Environment (TCLE) takes Autoprotocol (http://autoprotocol.org/), a high-level JSON description of a science protocols, and executes it on our custom-integrated robotic facilities. The protocols we handle routinely involve solving constraint programming models with thousands of variables and constraints in order to find the best plan that fulfills the scientist’s intent. We are looking for backend engineers to help us with this effort.

Scientists manage their experiments through our web application or via our API. We provide a single platform that controls scientific devices from many vendors in a unified way, and an interface to control our automated labs. We are looking for full-stack engineers to help build out our web app.

Turning science into an information technology requires being able to encode, abstract, and execute scientific intent programmatically. We work to span the gap between science and our software stack to ensure that science is being correctly abstracted and faithfully executed as well as work on the leading edge to create tooling for better protocol development. We are looking for software engineers with scientific knowledge to join our scientific software engineering group to help define and build out how science will be encoded.

Tech stack includes: Linux, Python, Scala, RabbitMQ, Rails, Typescript, React, Ansible, Postgres
Benefits include: full medical/dental/vision insurance; catered lunch and dinner, and a fully stocked kitchen; flexible vacation policy; 401(k) with matching; gym and commuter reimbursement; and education reimbursement up to $3,000/year.

Hazel Analytics | Data Scientist | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $150K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics is a fast-growing food tech company on a mission to create innovative products that transform the way organizations use food safety data. Founded in 2014 by prominent professors whose careers include decades of research at Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Maryland, we are the proven market leader in health department data analytics, serving nearly half of the largest 100 food retail chains.

Our Food Safety Insights (FSI) platform transforms diffuse and disparate local health department data into actionable intelligence. As a result, our customers — including Amazon, Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, and Whole Foods — can rely on Hazel Analytics technology to proactively monitor food safety and regulatory compliance at over 100,000 locations that serve millions of meals every day in the US and Canada.

Hazel Analytics is a proud recipient of the 2019 Food Marketing Institute Food Safety Innovation Award and the 2016 Jack in the Box Food Safety Innovation Award. We've also had opportunities to be involved in interesting projects such as this recent collaboration with ESPN: http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25316231/health-inspection-reports-find-critical-violations-nfl-nhl-nba-mlb-stadiums-2018-espn-lines

We are profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution.

As a data scientist with Hazel Analytics, you will help identify new opportunities and develop high-impact data analytics, predictive models, and statistical tools that will generate practical and actionable inputs for our user community. You will be expected to be both a creative and critical thinker, have strong judgment in prioritization and execution, and strike a balance between moving quickly and delivering high-trust analytics. Our ideal candidate not only thinks and acts like a leader but also rolls up their sleeves to explore and implement new analytical models.

Fast-growing FinTech startup | Full Stack Developer | Onsite | €50.000 ~ €62.000 | Berlin, Germany | VISA
TL;DR: If you want to write F# and TypeScript while working with cool people on a fast growing business, shoot me an e-mail!

We are a fast-growing FinTech startup with a team built out of seasoned people, both on the operational side and on the technical side. We are looking for a smart and motivated addition to our team in Berlin. The role is full-stack but we don't see a specific preference for either front- or backend as a downside.

You will work within an agile process, in a fast-moving but structured environment. You will have a high degree of autonomy and be expected to provide working solutions, taking responsibility from the conceptual phase up to after the delivery. You will have architectural and technical freedom, and we believe in using the best tool for the job (TypeScript & F# are examples).

We work with pull requests, do code review for every feature, we have a dedicated QA team and we try to automate things as much as possible. We do continuous integration, and believe in keeping a high-quality codebase. We love tests and TDD. In general, we strive to work according to best practices.

Here's what you bring to the table:

– Fluency in JavaScript both in frontend and backend.

– Experience with Node.js, and frontend frameworks such as React or equivalent.

– Experience with TypeScript or similarly typed languages. All new web code is written in TypeScript and old code is being progressively converted. We use F# in production and the financial services are written in it, and run on AWS.

– Strong awareness of the interplay between JavaScript and HTML & CSS, and familiarity with Single-Page Applications. Ideally, you have developed internal systems or Web Applications for complex business domains before.

– Strong communication skills with the ability to lead team meetings and find creative solutions to complex problems. You enjoy driving continuous improvement and innovation.

– Eagerness to learn new things. We don't believe in chasing fads, but we're not scared of learning new techniques when they're needed.

––––––––

Here's what we bring to the table:

– Competitive remuneration package, rewarded for the success of the business (equity).

– Learning and career development with weekly team teach-ins, as well as “extra-curricular” development: We make available a budget of 2% of your yearly wages which you can use at your disposal on training/workshops/learning, as long as it's business-related :-)

– Beautiful office in the heart of Berlin (Hackescher Markt).

– Choose your own equipment.

– Standard Berlin perks of social events, meet ups and, of course, snacks and free cold beer in the fridge.

Personal note: I've been working here for almost one year and I feel fulfilled and happy. This opening is to work with me on my team and I wouldn't post this on HN if I didn't feel it was a great opportunity.

If this all sounds interesting, send me an e-mail at adelgado1313@gmail.com, ideally with your CV and whatever else you'd like to show us, and let's set up a quick call or a coffee – whatever you prefer :-)
We will sponsor work visas for candidates who need sponsorship in order to be eligible to work in Europe.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer &amp; more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.

NoRedInk | Full-Stack, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers| San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

REMOTE (Worldwide) - Open Source Developer on Open edX - React, Python/Django, AWS/OpenStack (OpenCraft - Fully remote company)
Development specialized on the free software project Open edX, used by and in part developed by organizations like MIT, Harvard, McKinsey, and others, so you’ll have the opportunity to contribute to projects that are widely used and to be part of a thriving open source educational community. See edx.org, stanford.edu or fun-mooc.fr for examples of Open edX instances.

We are 27 senior developers, all working remotely from Europe, North & South America, Asia & Australia. The company is not affiliated with edX, but rather contributing and working with them on various projects.

The Open edX platform is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. You would work on different clients contracts using the platform. The clients list/references include Harvard, MIT, edX themselves, the French government, and various startups & universities currently running their own instances, or looking to create one. Tasks are very varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working fullstack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.

Most of your work is published as free software (Open edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing most of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.

We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.

You can read more about how we work in our handbook, at https://handbook.opencraft.com/

Stack: Python/Django, Ansible, AWS/OpenStack, React, Debian/Ubuntu, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Elasticsearch, JS, HTML/CSS.

The Trade Desk | Full Time, Onsite & Remote | Chicago IL, New York NY, San Jose CA, San Francisco CA, Aliso Viejo CA, Ventura CA, Boulder CO, Denver CO, Bellevue WA, Seattle WA, London UK, Sydney AUS, Shanghai CN
Hiring: Senior Software Engineers, as well as Senior Front-End focused engineers who are comfortable with data-access design, development and optimization.

You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk's dev team if:

You are a full-stack engineer who wants to work everywhere, not just a small subset of components. Experience / interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes: client-side React & Redux, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, many-layered data pipeline (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.) that moves hundreds of thousands of items per second, and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all.

 You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#/.Net, but specific experience here is not required.

Cool stuff about TTD:

* Our platform processes 9million+ queries per second

* Work with the best engineering team in AdTech

* The combination of huge data sets, high throughput, low latency and amazing scale means that we're constantly solving some of the biggest challenges in computer science.

* Amazing Company Culture

* Top-tier benefits

If you're interested, please apply directly on our website: https://www.thetradedesk.com/join-us/open-positions

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Engineering Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area.

US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself.

This position will be doing production troubleshooting with GraphQL, SQL, Logs, etc as well as building internal tools and automated testing based on your production experience

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact

New York Genome Center | Software Engineer | New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE
NYGC is not a software company; it is a sequencing lab trying to push science at scale, and needs software to do so. We are hungry to become the lead sequencing firm. We're aggressively building our clinical services, so if you have even the smallest allergy to documentation or process, please stop reading now.

These positions is for the Production Software Engineering group, which currently has twelve people. We're replacing prototypes with better solutions while rolling out new applications to help the organization with scale. People who join NYGC software are expected to learn quickly, be self-motivated, and be comfortable switching tracks. You don't have to understand e.g. genome sequence alignment, but you do have to be able to read a manual on a tool's use and learn enough vocabulary to have an intelligent conversation with an expert on the subject.

We are intentionally boring (https://valdhaus.co/writings/boring-systems/) in our technology choices because our goal is data analysis, not novel software work. We design everything for reliability, maintenance, low cost of ownership, and failure recovery. It is a combination of boring technology and fast pace: we are the computational pipeline team, the automation team, the LIMS team, the database team, and the data transport team (surprisingly fun at >20PB), the customer delivery team. We don't do genomic methods software (e.g. better variant calling) -- we have a great computational biology group for that. This group is focused on making a sequencing lab and automated analyses run at scale.

The lab and automation combined drive some really interesting real-world problems, particularly in the clinical space. How fast can we get first-order cancer screening done for people?

(contact info in my profile)

POSITIONS

1) Principal Software Engineer: Serve as a project lead. This person should be able to work independently and in a team, from requirements through implementation/iteration and testing and deployment. Python and postgresql on the backend, React on the frontend. We're looking for someone who has both python application development experience and javascript/front-end experience.
2) Senior Software Engineer: Serve as a primary contributor. Strong individual and team contributor, familiar with breaking down tasks into work plans, and then driving those plans through design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Python and postgresql on the backend, React on the frontend. We're looking for someone who has either strong python application development experience or strong javascript/front-end experience and is willing to learn/work in python.

I worked with DataCamp through their course authors program and found it to be a poorly run organization. They maintain a publicly accessible "wishlist" of courses that they claim to want to develop. Think twice before putting your course proposal forward: they'll want free labor from you in a form of course outlines and code samples. After you send these over to them, they'll tell you that they are no longer interested in working with you on the course from the wishlist and ask for other outlines and samples. Courtesy requests that are a norm in the industry, like taking a course off the wishlist while  you are working on it are ignored.
