Are you experienced with DevOps and working in AWS production environments? If you are, we'd love to hear how you can help us.

We're a retail company that's seeking DevOps expertise to help stabilize an older production environment based in AWS.

If you're a fit, you should (more or less) have something approximating these skills:

- Automation Expertise (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, or your preference. If it works, we're open to it.)

- CI/CD Expertise - We're running on a mix of 'git pull' and Capistrano. There are opportunities to modernize this a bit. We'd love the help.

- Rails Experience - Our platform runs on Rails. You should have Rails experience and be able to have an intelligent conversation about Rails.

- containers/kubernetes?- We're curious if our business would be a fit for a straight-up kubernetes migration. If you can help us assess if that migration makes sense, define a plan, and implement it, you're looking at an easy second project.

If this sounds like something you'd be able to help with, then send an email to me (Jack) at jahodges419 - at - gmail.com and tell me:

- Why you think you'd be a good fit to help us

- A project you worked on that showcases your Automation Expertise (just a few sentences)

- Your experience assessing kubernetes migrations (just a few sentences)
Please email to me, Jack, at jahodges419 - at - gmail.com. (Spam replies and copy/pasted replies that don't mention me, Jack, by name will be deleted.)

We intend on staying a remote-first team, but we're also trying to start a small Ann Arbor office if we can find the right person to join me here. Having a physical presence in a2 will allow us to hire interns/juniors and mentor them and such, which is more difficult to do remotely.

Dots - Game Design Studio | Staff Engineer | NYC | Onsite | Full time
Dots is a mobile game design studio in NYC. Our games are beautifully executed from a graphic design, game design, and technological perspective. Our aim is to create experiences that do the little things extremely well. This results in a minimalist experience that has all the things you need and love, but none of the things you don't. At Dots this approach is present in all verticals, and engineering is no exception. This is particularly true of any backend engineering position.

We're looking for a Staff Engineer with 10+ years of experience who will join the backend team. Your strengths are as an individual contributor, but you are a natural leader and mentor as well. In this role, you will touch many parts of the business, from creation of game services to iteration on our custom continuous integrations system, to optimization of our experimentation system, to the creation of tools that aid all other parts of the company. We love to create tools and services that delight our players AND our colleagues alike. We do this by having a solid roadmap of features, products, and tools that have the largest impact, implementing the minimal "lovable" offering, and iterating on that offering as need and usage increases. By approaching our workload in this way, we pay attention to what matters most, and are able to create real, discernible impact immediately.

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, numpy/scipy/pandas/scikit-learn, Dramatiq, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

Thanx Engineering

Here’s more on who we are:

• Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from startups and successful product companies like Google, Facebook, Intuit, Disney. This is an elite Eng team, period.

• Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform.

• Tech: scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency backend systems; beautiful, performant, responsive UIs; user-friendly mobile apps.
• Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing, and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours.

Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain) | Full Stack Engineer | Copenhagen Denmark | ONSITE | VISA
The project

Modern genome engineering technologies have enabled the rapid and precise editing of DNA, causing a paradigm shift in biotechnology: with the focus shifted from reading to writing genetic information, which of the three billion DNA letters in a human cell need to be rewritten in order to prevent disease, live longer, or encode entirely novel features?

The project we are hiring you for is about building a web-based application for computational aided design of cells. Communicating with biological knowledge bases and mathematical models (mechanistic and AI-based), the platform will guide engineers in writing the right DNA based on the entire computable knowledge available for a cell.

The job

We are looking for a full-stack developer. You will be dealing with biological concepts every day, discovering the best user experience for interacting with DNA and its encoded information. Deep understanding of biology is not a requirement though, most of the developers in the institute were able to gain the necessary knowledge after joining our team.

Our technology stack at the moment is:

- Angular, Angular Material, Typescript

- Python3.6 for the backend services (Flask, celery, etc.) and core scientific libraries

- Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j

- Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana

- Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform (GKE, Cloud SQL, Container Registry)
Please visit https://www.dtu.dk/english/About/JOB-and-CAREER/vacant-positions/job?id=aa7ebcbb-cdcc-47e7-b286-944fcaba8e37 for more info and submitting an application (DEADLINE April 15)

BitMEX | San Francisco | Onsite |Full-time| Kuberentes, Node, Mobile
BitMEX is a cryptocurrency P2P trading platform offering unrivaled liquidity, security, and career opportunities. Our platform was developed by ex-bankers who were (and are) well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance. BitMEX launched in 2014 and subsequently has grown to become one of the most important marketplaces in the crypto space. n a pulldown menu of “What industry are you in?” it is certainly fair to label BitMEX a fintech company. But we feel like the word “fintech” doesn’t do justice to the uniqueness or grandeur of what we’re building.

Our ambition is to be the pre-eminent futures market for the major crypto-coins (including new ones, as they arrive on the scene), and BitMEX is already is one of the most significant price discovery mechanisms for Bitcoin, which is the most established digital currency so far.

And since Bitcoin may yet turn out to be a civilisation-saving monetary instrument — mankind’s ultimate store of value — history may come to reveal that BitMEX’s trading platform played a crucial role in saving the world. Or, it might just unfold that Bitcoin is a helluva lot of fun for awhile, before petering out or blowing up for some unforeseen reason. Both scenarios are logically imaginable (to use the phrase, from another context, of Hungarian philosopher Tibor Machan).

One way or another, Bitcoin is the defining technology of our current era. And if you work at BitMEX, you will have been part of Bitcoin in the most essential and extreme possible way.
Our top positions right now are:
Mobile Engineer: https://grnh.se/ea3714a82
Kubernetes Engineer: https://grnh.se/57ca65ef2
API Engineer: https://grnh.se/499fb4222If you are interested, please apply to the position you believe you are best suited for and we will get back to you ASAP.

Dstillery | Backend Senior Software Engineer | New York City (NYC) | Onsite | Full time | https://dstillery.com/
We're seeking a quality-focused Senior Software Engineer who wants to learn about large systems and how hard problems related to scale are solved. We currently handle over 100 billion events per day and need someone who can help us handle billions more. We're still pretty small on the engineering team, and everyone gets their hands dirty and makes a real impact.

In addition to gaining deep experience with developing systems at scale, you'll work with a world-class data science team (winners of multiple KDD Best Paper and other awards) that keeps us on the cutting edge of machine learning research. You'll gain direct exposure to the ins and outs of the rapidly growing and evolving adtech industry.

We place a high value on maintaining a good work-life balance, avoiding grinds and focusing on getting things done rather than putting in long hours. A bunch of us play ultimate frisbee or soccer on Fridays, and we have regular dev seminars and lunch-and-learns to talk tech and learn from each other.

Required Technical Skills:

* 4+ Years of professional experience in Java.

* Experience building and owning, high volume, high availability distributed systems

* Knowledge of building and consuming RESTful services

* Experience with SQL and relational database design

* Write high-quality code using modern best practices

One or more of the following is considered a huge plus:

* Previous adtech or martech industry experience

* You’ve worked with: Kafka, Cassandra, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, or similar technologies

* Experience developing ETL pipelines.

* Experience with Javascript frameworks/HTML/CSS

* Knowledge of Machine Learning, Distributed Systems or Big Data.

* Exposure to CI / CD (with either Docker, Kubernetes, SaltStack or Jenkins)

If this interests you, you can apply here!

commercetools | Software Engineer - Scala | On-Site | Full-Time | Berlin, Germany | https://commercetools.com/careers
We combine solving hard tech challenges you’d expect in a Silicon Valley startup with German work/life balance.

Our Backend-as-a-Service powers commerce in a wide range of industries, including automotive, robotics, gaming, on-demand printing, fashion and toys. We don’t run mom-and-pop stores - we excel for enterprise customers that need a commerce platform that is both customizable and yet highly scalable and reliable.

Some of the challenges you can help us with:

* Scaling a multi-tenant BaaS with heterogeneous traffic patterns. We continuously improve the performance of our code (written in Scala) as well as our persistence layer (MongoDB and ElasticSearch).

* Rework our data models where they aren’t suitable for our biggest enterprise customers. E.g. we need to support retailers with inventory across hundreds of stores.

* Multi-cloud, multi-region deployment: We offer our customers a choice between different cloud providers (including AWS and GCP) and regions.

* Adopt new technologies in our developer-facing products. E.g. we invest in GraphQL and CloudEvents, and participate in specification processes as well as Open Source projects.

We’re 150 people from 35 countries. We offer flexible work hours, home office and are parent friendly. I myself leave the office at 3:30pm three times a week to spend the afternoon with my son, and then spent another 2 hours working at home in the evening.
For the Scala job in our team see: https://commercetools-jobs.personio.de/job/41580?language=en# 
Feel free to message me if you have any questions at christoph DOT neijenhuis AT companyname DOT com (No recruiters, no agencies please.)

unnamed project | los angeles | software | part-time | onsite
This is mostly a stealth project and I'm trying to form a team. I'm the one that did the original search for this thing in about 2015 and have done a lot of startups for about 20 years. There's a couple exits in there.

This is the ground floor and I don't waste my time with vague nonsense ideas. There's existing code, a business plan and it's about to close a couple million dollar round.

There's half a dozen people involved and it has something to do with games and fintech. I know this is very vague, but if you can trust me, contact me at my username @ gmail.com. It should be fun.
I promise nothing more than adventure.

Waldo Photos | Senior Software Engineers  | Full-Time | Austin, TX  or REMOTE (Globally)
Waldo Photos (https://waldophotos.com/) is a photo finding platform utilizing facial and object recognition to empower consumers to toss their selfie sticks, put their phones back in their pockets and live in the moment. Waldo is the only platform that removes all of the friction in getting photos of you taken by others and creates new opportunities for photographers to market and sell their photos. Users can enjoy life’s most precious events and automatically receive images taken of them right on their phones or share images of others they’ve taken without having to lift a finger – whether between friends and family or a professional photographer.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself. And while camps and schools have been the first areas that Waldo has gained traction, the challenge of matching and delivery of the photos you care about is luckily not limited to just summer camps and schools which is further driving our product and market growth.

To meet this demand we are hiring immediately(and through the year) for:

* Senior Backend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/BE760CF400

* Senior Frontend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/7038D86015

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact
   * Market Competitive Salary
   * Stock options
   * Unlimited vacation policy
   * Fully remote work environment with a flexible work schedule
   * Startup growth and energy

If this interests you or you have questions, please reach out to me via email using the address in my profile and I will be happy to answer anything or you can apply directly via the links above.

<still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see each position).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer & more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4-5months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a lead/managerial role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)
More keywords for the CTRL+F'ers ;) : F#, C#, Xamarin, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, blockchain, smart contracts, stable coins, MakerDAO/DAI, etc.

Data privacy and data protection should be a no-brainer. But the reality is many departments within organizations are not well-equipped to comply, so we're trying to help make that a more seamless process. In doing so, we think this will help give users more control over their personal data.

Chargefox | Melbourne, AU | Mid to senior software engineer | ONSITE | https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1196426058
Full time opportunity for a full-stack developer with expertise in React Native.

ABOUT CHARGEFOX

Chargefox is committed to sustainable mobility. We're Australia's largest open, electric vehicle (EV) network for modern EV's. As part of that, Chargefox raised $17 million to build a network of ultra-rapid chargers to connect major cities across the country, but that's only a fraction of what we do. We have an unwavering focus on simplifying the EV charging experience for everyone - be they drivers, fleet managers, charge station owners, car manufacturers, energy retailers or more.

Our customers can find, use and pay for electric vehicle charging using their mobile. We’re continually adding new stations to the Chargefox network. So far we've processed over 20,000 charging sessions on more than 500 plugs across Australia and New Zealand, dispensing a total of over 165MWh of electricity. That's enough electricity to power the average household for two decades, and we're still growing fast. We're excited!

Our apps are built in React Native, and we're looking for someone to join the team to help. Values really matter (really!), so we’re looking for someone who’s a great fit for these - (Customer Focus, Sustainability, Safety, Transparency, Integrity and Collaboration).

WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR
We're looking for someone with a deep expertise in React Native (experts in React or Android/iOS will be considered as well) who will be able to provide both technical leadership for the team and to also deliver features. At the same time you will be working and contributing on a variety of tasks including development and support of Ruby APIs, web applications and AWS infrastructure.
Remember our value on Customer Focus above? We want to see empathy for the driver and their experience along the way too.
We expect you to know how to build scalable and well architected software solutions. We're looking for engineers, rather than coders. At Chargefox, we are big believers in a pragmatic and agile approach to software development. You will be participating in team rituals including stand-ups, retrospectives, occasional pair-programming and on-call support. We are based in Melbourne, so you will be working in our office in the CBD.
SO, WHY US?
A chance to join a growing and dynamic start-up enabling the uptake of electric vehicles in Australia. This is a unique opportunity to be an integral part of something that is of true value to society.
We are fully funded and offer a competitive salary package.
A collaborative and supportive environment that will stretch you, but give you a chance to learn from and teach others.
We'll supply you with a new company laptop (if you need one).
If you think that we sound like a great place to work and you fit the bill, then please get in touch and send through your details.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Solar United Neighbors | IT Generalist | Full-time | Washington, DC | ONSITE or REMOTE | https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org
Women, minorities, people with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

Solar United Neighbors is a national nonprofit that organizes local communities around the country to go solar, join together, and fight for their energy rights.

We’re growing fast -- really fast. We’re expanding into new states, building new partnerships, and offering new services. That kind of growth requires a great IT infrastructure to help our members and supporters organize and advocate for solar at the state and national level. Your job is to help build the infrastructure that powers our growth.

IN THE FIRST YEAR, you can expect to work on projects that include:

- Work with our Go Solar team to CUSTOMIZE SALESFORCE to support new product lines and workflows, streamline their workload, and increase our ability to report on campaign performance.

- UPGRADE OUR COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (mass email, advocacy, event management, donations) to a more effective and flexible system (or systems) and integrate them with both our websites and with SalesForce.

- Work with our Growth team to REBUILD OUR WEBSITES to be more user-friendly, accessible, and effective at engaging our community of solar supporters.

- Work with our Engagement Director to DEVELOP WEB APPLICATIONS that automate the internal workflow for our two major national solar awareness campaigns -- Brews from the Sun and the National Solar Tour.

We’ve gone all-in with WordPress for our websites, so you need to know your way around WORDPRESS (and PHP in general) really well. Most of our core business logic lives in SALESFORCE, so you need to know how to customize SalesForce (custom objects, reports, workflows). Deploying and managing the servers will be your responsibility, so you need to be effective on the LINUX command line. And we have some data analysis projects on deck, so you need to be comfortable setting up DATABASES and writing SQL queries.

Just as important as all those technical skills -- maybe more! -- you need to be a COMMITTED TEAM PLAYER who is ready to shoulder responsibility, find the opportunity hidden in every problem, and build other people up.

Finally, you need to bring a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. We’re huge fans of applying the LEAN STARTUP model to our work -- building quick prototypes to test our ideas in the real world, collecting data to measure how well those ideas perform, and learning from that data so we can make the next version even better. If you bring data analysis skills, that’s a huge plus. Either way, an “ALWAYS BE TESTING” attitude is required.
You'll report directly to the VP OF GROWTH (me) and work with a committed and brilliant team of communications experts, policy wonks, digital marketers, and community organizers on projects with ambitious goals and aggressive deadlines.
Full details here: https://www.idealist.org/en/nonprofit-job/b37efcac8ec14283ba8d4792f9f3246b-versatile-and-enthusiastic-it-generalist-solar-united-neighbors-washington

Quora | {ML, ML infrastructure} {Engineer, Engineering Manager} | Mountain View, CA | Full-time, ONSITE
Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. We are a web-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know.

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past year we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.

NoRedInk |Full-Stack Engineers,Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Engineering Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area.

US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

Tasks are very varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working fullstack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.

Most of your work is published as free software (Open edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing most of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.

We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.
