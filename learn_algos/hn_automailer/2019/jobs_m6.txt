Eleos Technologies | Remote (US only) | Full time
Eleos Technologies is a growing 8-year-old company building communication software for truck drivers and field workers.

We’re helping a diverse mix of customers—from mom and pop operations to household names—improve how they communicate with their employees by tackling information overload, reducing phone calls, and eliminating obsolete technologies.

We're looking for someone to own and evolve our web backends. The primary backend is built on Erlang/OTP, plus supporting systems built in Clojure (image processing) and Ruby on Rails (dashboard, billing UI, those bits.) As a small team, we've all helped build and grow these systems, but we're ready for a specialist!

In addition to the above technologies, we're running on AWS, using PostgreSQL, although we're keen to remember that all these things are tools and not identities.
If that sounds fun and rewarding to you, the full description and info about applying are over here: https://eleostech.com/careers.html

Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because:
- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.
- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Kalepa | Machine Learning Engineers, Backend / Data Engineers, Full-Stack Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Me | part time backend node dev | Sydney | Onsite
I've got an open room in a penthouse on the beach in Sydney. Essentially I'd like you to come live in it for free and work part time on one of my open source side projects. This is the view you'd wake up to: https://i.imgur.com/3TiTwBp.jpg and the view from the other side of the apartment: https://i.imgur.com/7c3D4En.jpg . It's not bad. I've got surfboards if as well if you're into that, and the snorkeling just out front is some of the best in Sydney: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKrdldogMLw

Position is from now until March. Three days a week on my project gets you a free room and free food.

About the project itself: Creating a Patreon meets Reddit kinda site. User pays $5/mo, we take $1 to run the servers without ads or tracking, then the remaining $4 gets split evenly between everything they upvoted that month. Philosphies I'm going into this with: Entirely open source, no ads ever, all analytics are purely opt-in. I'm a front end guy and right now I'm grinding my gears with the backend, so anyone that can create node apis secured with JWTs is really who I need.

FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA
FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!

We're also in a sweet spot for ambitious and talented engineers; we have a lot of traction and are well-financed, but still have a very small team responsible for a wide range of work enabling you to take ownership of large slices of our technology stack.

Technologies: Ruby, Clojure, Rails, JavaScript, Backbone, React, React Native

Command E | Senior Software Engineer (engineer #2) | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE (North America only)
Hi HN! I'm the Founder & CTO of Command E…a lightning-fast, secure way to instantly find anything in the cloud with a simple keyboard shortcut. We're building a desktop app (Electron/React/Redux/SQLite) that syncs cloud data locally to your laptop and provides a Spotlight-like search & command interface on top of your cloud data.

Command E is basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data. It's inspired by the "fuzzy finder" search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, ⌘T in Atom, ⌘P in VSCode, etc.). The app has a lot of polish and a very clean, simple design. We already support many enterprise and consumer cloud services (Salesforce, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Asana, Trello, 15+ more).

We're a small team of 3 Silicon Valley veterans, well-capitalized by top Silicon Valley VC firms + angel investors. Both co-founders are engineers who worked at a VC firm, Eventbrite, and Digg. Our office is at 2nd and Market in San Francisco.
We're looking to hire 2 senior/core engineers. You'll be building a top-notch Silicon Valley company with experienced founders going after a massive market: search. Electron experience (or desire) is a big plus, but we're open to other backgrounds too. My co-founder and I met ~5 years ago through a "Who's Hiring" thread so we're excited to see who responds to this one - please email me at ben@getcommande.com if you’re interested.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning through software and cutting-edge analytics leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

Apollo Agriculture (https://apolloagriculture.com/) | Amsterdam, NL or Nairobi, Kenya | ONSITE
Apollo Agriculture is bringing commercial farming to everyone, starting with farmers in Kenya. We take a proven package of agricultural inputs, the training to use them, and sell them on credit to farmers at a price they can afford. We have great credit models that help us figure out who will pay us back and a custom digital loan pipeline that helps us make these small loans in an efficient way.

We use Scala + Postgres on the backend, Kotlin on our mobile team, and python on our DS team, but are increasingly moving towards scala all over. (For Scala, on the scale from "Java++" to "Bad Haskell" I'd say we're right in the middle. We use a number of functional features but are pragmatists about it.)
We're hiring for excellent software engineers, with a slight preference towards backend engineers currently. To apply, email earl@apolloagriculture.com with a LinkedIn, a resume, or something that shows me why you're fantastic.

LetsCompass | Front end developer | San Francisco / Boston / Remote | pre-product: https://www.letscompass.com/
We are a startup that is delivering transformative lead-generation and lead-enhancement solutions, as well as other point-solutions based on web scraping. We have a highly effective dynamic web scraper, with a focus on delivering customizable data sets to build and enhance sales leads. We believe that sales teams should be focused on selling - our product finds leads and automates the prospecting process, so sales teams can focus on what they do best.

We want to turn the sales process on its head. Instead of acquiring cheap / unreliable leads, and relying on an army of salespeople to prospect and qualify those targets, clients can use our software to set prospecting parameters from the start. That way, sales professionals can find the exact leads they want, and never prospect again.

We are hiring a front end dev to rebuild an outdated, existing front end for our new back end. We have repositioned our web scraper from a price comparison chrome plugin (linked above) to serve a more robust function as a lead generation tool. You would be integral in redesigning the front end for our new product!

BuySellAds (https://buysellads.com) | Fully REMOTE (US timezones strongly preferred)
We’re looking for an integration engineer with ad tech experience who wants to make ad tech a little less crappy
About us: 
BuySellAds operates the largest self-serve advertising marketplace on the web. We're an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently. Don’t let the "adtech" part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.
Dribbble, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft Azure, Slack, Digital Ocean, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.

We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 49 people spread out across 25 cities in 5 countries. We primarily use Rails and React, with a smattering of Go and PHP, but seek to hire developers who are language agnostic and are more interested in shipping quality code than bikeshedding it.
Interested? Send an email to dev+q2@buysellads.com (or ping me directly, firstname@) with some details on your background and what interests you about working with us.

Repod | Mobile Engineer (React Native + iOS + Android) | Full-Time | Remote | San Diego
At Repod, our goal is to empower people to discover, listen, and share great podcasts. Podcasts are unique in that they inspire us, help us learn something new, or captivate us with the way stories are told. Yet, all of these experiences are rarely shared with one another. By connecting people with an easy way to share and discuss podcasts, Repod helps people find and listen to great podcasts.

Currently, we are a two person team (2 cofounders) and are looking for our 1st full-time team member by way of mobile engineer. We are in the midst of a public beta and will be launching in the near future.

As the lead mobile engineer at Repod, you'll initially be working in our main repo developing and launching new features. Repod is built using React Native and relies heavily on a native audio player built in Swift/Java. As we expand our product, you’ll help inform the technologies used in our future growth. The team is small, which means your impact on the company’s success will be instrumental.

We have one requirement — must love podcasts.

YNAB | Full Stack Developer | Remote | Full Time
We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives.  Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.

You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).

You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.

Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).

You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application.
You can find out more information and apply here: https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5

I like working with TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a skilled and friendly team. On a daily basis I learn new things about databases and the cloud, but I also get to apply my existing experiences to have a big impact.

Product Manager and Sr. Product Manager | San Francisco | REMOTE | https://www.airbase.com
Airbase is the first all-in-one spend management platform that provides companies unparalleled control and visibility into every dollar spent. Finance teams deserve a solution that eliminates the tedious work involved in managing spend and allows them to focus on being strategic partners to the rest of the business.

Our customers include companies like Gusto, Netlify, Getaround, Segment and many others.
We're hiring Product Managers and Sr. Product Managers.

Do you enjoy spending time with your family, friends, and hobbies instead of working after hours or commuting? Or perhaps a work environment that plans its deadlines around your vacations, and not the other way around, with management that shields you from the vicissitudes of the outside world and leaves you the time you need for focused, deep, uninterrupted work?
Consider Cavulus. We've put together an all-remote development team and a suite of powerful tools to tackle problems in the healthcare space, an industry notorious for surviving on Cobol, flat-file systems, and old spreadsheets. Studies have shown that 30% of overall healthcare costs are directly attributable to these redundant and outdated processes. We've brought workflow automation, modern data science, advanced interface tools, real-time stream processing, and people together to bring healthcare costs down for everyone.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

FastMail | Philadelphia | ONSITE | Full-time

We're looking for an Email Client Application developer to join the FastMail team in our Center City Philadelphia office.

Together with the rest of our team, you'll work on our email services FastMail, Pobox, and Topicbox. When the vast majority of people get email for free, the reason people choose a paid service is because they value both privacy and a great user experience.

You'll be working on our best-in-breed mail clients, providing super-fast, powerful access to webmail, calendars, contacts and more. You’ll work with our collaborative team of front- and back-end developers, designers and researchers. Improving our customers’ interactive experience, keeping it secure and a delight to use is what we do, every day.

Our interfaces are built upon our own Overture framework and the new email standard JMAP. It gives us full control from top to bottom to build the right solutions to difficult problems. If you've worked with other MVC application frameworks, like Apple's Cocoa, you should find Overture easy to pick up.

You'll have the opportunity to work at many levels:

* building features from scratch with our design and product teams

* optimizing and improving existing code

* tracking down and fixing elusive bugs reported by customers
Email us at jobs@fastmail.com to introduce yourself and tell us why you would be a good fit for the job! This job requires clear communication, so that message is part of your application, but please also include a PDF of your resume.

Metomic (https://metomic.io) | London | ONSITE | Backend Engineer and Fullstack
Our mission is to build a new standard for data privacy and data ethics.

We believe strongly in the power of sharing data, but we realise that consumers need controls and transparency before they can trust companies with it. And we believe that the way to get this right is to make it as _easy as possible_ for companies to do the right thing.

So that's what we're building. Technology that watches technology, helps make sense of the all-too-common mess of sprawling internal data flow, and a consumer facing plug-n-play user-experience to close the loop.

We just launched a consent manager on ProductHunt (on Wednesday) and reached #2 product of the day

We're still an early seed-stage startup with competitive salaries and equity to boot. As an early member, you'll be helping us define the future of this space. If you like autonomy, ownership and have opinions ... come say hi!

Wellcome Sanger Institute | Full-Time | On-site | Cambridge, UK
Hello! Do you know UNIX and how to responsibly manage compute, and want to work in an academic environment?

You could move to Cambridge and replace me:

https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-bioinformatician-wormbase-388186.html

In fact you should do better than me, because it now says  senior and I wasn't a senior. I have really enjoyed working at this job, and I'm leaving it after a year and a half because I'm moving to the United States.

It's for a resource with genomes of parasitic worms. You'll support a small community of researchers that study host-parasite interactions, search for candidate new drugs, and in general are worth supporting.

The bread and butter of the job is writing and running code that moves data around and runs heavy computations on it, resulting in a new data release every few months. You'll help researchers at Sanger with their use of the resource, reply to helpdesk tickets, write to ask people for data, and go to conferences once or twice a year.

You'll be a Bioinformatician, not a Developer, which means your code can be as good as you want it to be, but there are no brownie points for it. There is opportunity to develop more stuff - I've had a half a year long greenfield project - but it's more important that releases happen, and that the data is correct.
The team is tiny, and the amount of good stuff you do will be limited by how much time you have, so this really suits someone who can handle responsibility well. It helps to know Perl and have bioinformatics experience but you can learn both on the job if you meet other prerequisites.

Waive | Los Angeles LA Hollywood | Fullstack PHP Python Product Automotive Mechanical Electrical Engineer | Onsite - Full-Time | DoE
We're a (mostly) electric urban mobility company founded in 2015, a bit before the current wave of them being everywhere.

I'm running a team of 3 engineers and am looking for a few more at our family-sized company which may be doing some scaling soon.  We have tens of thousands of customers, millions in assets, it's a real thing.

There's a few innovative products in here somewhere and I'm being a bit guarded because there's more than one company with tens of millions in funding who had us multiple times in their pitch deck (one just closed another $30 million last week, splendid).

Anyway, we were on Shark Tank in 2016 and have done a couple iterations of the product since then. We just did a major pivot on May 1st.

Here's our plan for the next year or so, listed in order (highest first):
* A new ad platform for our screens (a version we're going to throw away is at waivescreen.com)
 * An on-demand gig economy car (see maven, envoy, hyrecar, and getaround for imho, poorly executed examples). This includes
    * backoffice work (currently in node but new stuff can be in whatever)
    * a new app or some other kind of smartphone presence (stability and Donald-Norman style UX as opposed to art-school UX is all I care about)
 * New innovative ad tech (see firefly, grabbit, blip, adomni, etc)
 * Open-architecture, open platform telematics that don't suck (see invers & vulog)
This may sound a bit ambitious but really a lamp developer who has read a couple marketing books would be just fine.

So just email me already at chris@waive.car ... you've already made it this far.
Please include a sample of your work.

Flock Cover | London, United Kingdom | Senior Software Engineer / Software Engineer | Full time | Onsite | Permanent
Our insurance / risk intelligence startup seeks full-stack developers interested in building systems in a mix of Haskell, OCaml, typed JavaScript (Flow / TypeScript), React Native and PostgreSQL.

Flock provides drone operators both risk insights for individual flights and the ability to purchase micro-duration, 'real-time' insurance policies in case of crashes or vehicle loss. Large drones that fail in the wrong place, the wrong time can cause enormous amounts of damage, so our platform uses insurance pricing to incentivise smarter behaviour and reward careful pilots with cheaper insurance costs.

We are seed funded, are seeking series A, and have an engineering team of five. Presently our team makeup is of quite senior engineers, but we are very open to recruiting enthusiastic mid-weight and junior developers, particularly if you have an interest in type systems and functional programming.

Why Haskell? Because we think strong type systems, static analysis and provability are the best ways to ensure the reliability needed in financial services without sacrificing our ability to rapidly develop and deliver continuously. These are our core engineering values, and they matter to us far more than existing knowledge of particular languages and frameworks.

As such, we require no prior commercial Haskell experience, just a polyglot attitude and a broad familiarity with functional programming (perhaps in languages like JavaScript, Scala, Clojure or F#). JS experience would be helpful but is again not essential.
If you're interested, please find the full job specification here: https://flockcover.workable.com/j/E0ACFDBBEE

Neos | London, UK / Brighton, UK / Partial remote | Full-time | https://neos.co.uk
Neos are an insurance company, making use of IoT devices to prevent issues before they turn into a claim, and give people peace of mind that their home is alright. We also have B2B deals with several major insurance companies, including Aviva in the UK, ANWB in the Netherlands, and American Family in the US to provide our IoT platform as a part of their insurance policies. Finally, we do direct retail sales of our camera to the public.

That's quite a lot to get done, so we're looking for Ruby developers to join the team. Depending on your experience and interests you'd either be working with the insurance team, looking after our policy admin and sales systems for direct insurance sales, or the IoT team who are responsible for device integration, B2B support, and providing APIs for our mobile apps to integrate with.

We've got a micro (but not too micro) service based architecture, which makes heavy use of AWS services such as SQS and SNS to ensure one part of the system failing doesn't take everything else down with it. Experience with distributed systems would definitely be a plus, especially in the IoT side of things where when we say "distributed" we mean "thousands of devices scattered around the world, on potentially unreliable internet connections". You'll get used to eventual consistency fast!

We're looking for people who are able to work out of either our London or Brighton office for at least some of the week. Most of team work remotely on a regular basis, and we're well set up to make that work - all our meeting rooms are set up to make people joining remotely easy.
If you're interested, drop me an email on jon.wood@neos.co.uk and I can answer any questions you might have.

SWAT | Junior Software Engineer | Singapore | Onsite | Fulltime
We help companies / governments provide more efficient transportation for their employees / residents by figuring out routes that minimize travel duration, and provide greater insight for both operators and passengers.

I personally joined the company for two reasons. First, I knew the founder to be a solid software engineer and caring/honest person. Second, I've seen first hand how soul crushing long commutes can be for people who don't live near public transportation and/or work strange hours (and how this problem overwhelmingly impacts the poor).

We're looking for junior backend and frontend developers. Frontend is in React (and some parts in Angular). Backend is in Go, but we're starting to move most stuff to Elixir. Prior experience in these specific technologies isn't a requirement. Questions / resumes can be sent to karl@swatmobile.io

Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/

Overview: Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception of flavor, aroma, and texture to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products, enter new markets, and optimize their existing brands. We're a diverse 12 person post Series-A company.

Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, Java, GraphQL, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS

The Position(s)

_Data Science_: We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. Our Data Science team develops new models and algorithms from scratch to make second-order inference on sparse data sets from non-representative samples that generalizes to the underlying target population. We rely on cutting edge models such as persistent homology, PU Learning, and metric learning to make predictions on non-eucldian human sensory data. We don't use tensor flow or pandas or keras as they are not a good fit for our problem space. We prefer a deep understanding of math and stats VS experience running logistic regressions in Python. (but we're cool with Python / Logit / experience)

_Engineering_: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Data-Engineers with experiance in micro-batch processing for machine learning pipelines.
Next Steps: please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

ELI Beamlines | Data Management Specialist, CS Engineers| Prague, Czech Republic | ONSITE, VISA
ELI Beamlines is a European Petawatt laser research facility where an international team currently installs the world’s most intense laser systems.

We are in the middle of commissioning and getting our first users and producing data - and now we have to start handling that. Currently, we are building our first storage system (PB-range), and facing challenges regarding high-throughput applications, cataloguing / metadata of complex scientific data, integration of computational infrastructure, integration into the grid and with off-site data centers,..

We're building a small team for that, and I'm looking for well-rounded, hands-on personalities who can both implement solutions for sometimes quite challenging applications, but also work with different scientific stakeholders to negotiate tradeoffs and policies.

https://www.eli-beams.eu/en/careers/scientific/scientific-data-management-specialist-software-engineer/

The profile is intentionally a big vague because I can fill 2-3 roles (and a couple of more in the CS department)- and if the profile fits, create new ones. I can also see someone working closer to the DAQ chain or the e-infrastructure side.
Also (not so related to HN, but why not try): I'm always looking for LabVIEW and PLC developers..

Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k
https://root.engineering/

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Namebase | SF and REMOTE | Full-time | https://namebase.io
Namebase is a domain registrar and onramp for the Handshake blockchain.

Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS. It's a protocol that's similar to Bitcoin, except that instead of using the coins for money, you use Handshake coins to register names on the Handshake blockchain. Handshake names are top-level domain names (.com, .io,. org, etc), and they're different from normal domain names because they're unstoppable; no one can censor, tamper with, or seize your name from you. Furthermore, Handshake names are associated with public keys, which enables SSL without relying on Certificate Authorities (a failure point in the security of DNS today).

Namebase is a domain registrar and exchange for Handshake (we're a separate company from the Handshake Foundation). You can register and manage Handshake names on our website, and if you don't have any coins, you can buy some using dollars or bitcoin on our exchange.

We're looking for a distributed systems engineer to work on the core Handshake protocol. If you enjoy doing open-source work, are interested in distributed systems, game theory, and cryptography, then come join our team!

We're also hiring for a backend engineer. Building an exchange is a non-trivial task — you need to manage customer funds safely, maintain zero-downtime and latency, and implement strong security practices mirroring that of a financial institution. If this sounds interesting to you please reach out.
Our mission at Namebase is to give an unstoppable name to everyone on the internet. Handshake makes it possible to have DNS that can't be shut down — even the Great Firewall of China can't censor Handshake names. We have the opportunity to change how the internet works, and our team is small enough that you'll have immense impact on our software development and company direction. Message tieshun @ our domain if you're interested!

We integrate with many saas solutions, data lakes (s3 + json/parquet/orc/etc) and data warehouses (redshift, snowflake, etc) to easily access, delete and/or anonymize data.

We have paying customers and have raised over $4m (with plenty of runway).

TalkJS | REMOTE (Europe) or ONSITE (Eindhoven, Netherlands) | https://talkjs.com
TalkJS lets developers build custom chat features in hours instead of months. We're product driven and we power communication inside online marketplaces, community sites, trading platforms and so on.
⠀
-- HEAD OF SALES --
Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing to the point that we have more leads than we can manage. This means that now is the time to double down on sales, so we're looking to make our first dedicated sales hire.

We're looking for someone who:


    * Loves tech
    * Has demonstrable experience selling technology B2B
    * Wants to jump on a rocket ship that's just taking off²

We offer you an opportunity to start, build, and lead our sales team as we grow. Significant equity is on the table, as well as the chance to work in a great collaborative, open and constructive distributed team culture.
Read more & apply via https://talkjs.com/jobs/

²) I'm well aware that this is a platitude, but in our case it's really quite true and it wasn't half a year ago. We're blowing up and we need your help :-)
⠀
-- MOBILE DEVELOPER WHO LOVES API DESIGN --
TalkJS is currently focused on the web and that's just not good enough. Easy to use APIs and SDKs are the key to our success on the web, and we're looking to do this natively on mobile as well. We could use your help with that.

If you're an experienced developer who's good at coming up with Java and Swift APIs that Android/iOS devs love to use, then get in touch. We don't have the job opening published yet, so just email to hey@talkjs.com. Bonus points if you can show us an API you designed (on any platform).
Like the sales job, this is remote (Europe) or on-site in Eindhoven, NL.
⠀
No recruiters or agencies, please.

Zulip | https://zulipchat.com/ | REMOTE or in San Francisco | Senior Mobile Engineer | Full-time | SF
Zulip is the leading 100% free and open source alternative to Slack. Our users love Zulip because of our unique UX with threaded conversations; compared to Slack or its clones, they find discussions in Zulip more productive. See our website for details, or read some Hacker News comment threads filled with Zulip love:* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16863675
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17622987
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18400988
We have a handful of people in the USA, amplified by our enormous and amazing open source contributor community. The entire product is open source; we make money selling hosting on Zulip Cloud as well as commercial support for on-site deployments.

This is an open-source job: all our code is open source and free software. We do our development in the open on GitHub and our own public Zulip instance at chat.zulip.org, and dozens of people contribute code every week from all around the world. You can be anywhere in the world too.

We're primarily looking for an experienced engineer excited about taking our mobile apps to the next level. The ideal candidate has full-stack engineering skills, is experienced at participating in open source communities, has great design sense, gets stuff done, and (if not in SF) has done work remotely before, either professionally or in a major open source project. But ideal candidates may not exist, and we're willing to compromise on some of these things :).

We are also always opportunistically hiring for impressive candidates interested in working on other parts of Zulip (UI/design, infrastructure/scalability, growth, etc.).

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Experience in the following is a plus:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

Language experience: any logic/constraint language (required), C / C++ (plus)

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

commercetools | Software Engineer - Scala | On-Site | Full-Time | Berlin, Germany | https://commercetools.com/careers
We combine solving hard tech challenges you’d expect in a Silicon Valley startup with German work/life balance.

Our Backend-as-a-Service powers commerce in a wide range of industries, including automotive, robotics, gaming, on-demand printing, fashion and toys. We don’t run mom-and-pop stores - we excel for enterprise customers that need a commerce platform that is both customizable and yet highly scalable and reliable.

Some of the challenges you can help us with:

* Scaling a multi-tenant BaaS with heterogeneous traffic patterns. We continuously improve the performance of our code (written in Scala) as well as our persistence layer (MongoDB and ElasticSearch).

* Rework our data models where they aren’t suitable for our biggest enterprise customers. E.g. we need to support retailers with inventory across hundreds of stores.

* Multi-cloud, multi-region deployment: We offer our customers a choice between different cloud providers (including AWS and GCP) and regions.

* Adopt new technologies in our developer-facing products. E.g. we invest in GraphQL and CloudEvents, and participate in specification processes as well as Open Source projects.

We’re 150 people from 35 countries. We offer flexible work hours, home office and are parent friendly. I myself leave the office at 3:30pm three times a week to spend the afternoon with my son, and then spent another 2 hours working at home in the evening.

very very spaceship | backend engineers, client (Unity) engineers | Seattle, WA | ONSITE, FULL-TIME | https://vvspaceship.website/
VVS is an indie game studio based out of the Fremont neighborhood in Seattle, founded by the creator of the BAFTA award-winning game, 'Never Alone'. We're currently about 15 folks, privately funded, and have a history of working with partners like Google, Microsoft and others. We're currently in pre-production on a multi-year mobile title with a major publisher.

We tend to work on projects where pioneering technologies intersect shared game experiences. We take great care when choosing our partners, the projects we focus on and the audiences we develop with.  We're adept at collaboration which leads to authentic and novel experiences that add whimsy and joy to the world. Everyone in the studio identifies as a maker, with skills and interests outside of game development. We're an eclectic crew and love to share our passions with each other and the world. Week to week, you'll find us hacking around with 3D printing, modular synths, D&D campaigns, model building, electronics, Ukrainian egg dying, building custom Gashapon capsule stations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mWMOf1NBbM), resin casting and more.

We value our creativity and love to learn and grow, so we hold quarterly game jams to keep our skills sharp. Sometimes we even release the games we make during the jam: http://k2mu.fish.

On the engineering side, we prefer generalists. People with a little bit of knowledge in a wide breadth of areas and who are comfortable not always having the answers, but excited to find them.
If you're interested to work on projects worth making, with people that are worth making them with, drop me an email at bj@vvspaceship.email and I'll do my best to answer any questions and provide more detail on the magic that's happening here. Thanks!

Waldo Photos | Senior Software Engineers | Full-Time | Austin, TX or REMOTE (Globally)
Waldo Photos (https://waldophotos.com/) is a photo finding platform utilizing facial and object recognition to empower consumers to toss their selfie sticks, put their phones back in their pockets and live in the moment. Waldo is the only platform that removes all of the friction in getting photos of you taken by others and creates new opportunities for photographers to market and sell their photos. Users can enjoy life’s most precious events and automatically receive images taken of them right on their phones or share images of others they’ve taken without having to lift a finger – whether between friends and family or a professional photographer.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself. And while camps and schools have been the first areas that Waldo has gained traction, the challenge of matching and delivery of the photos you care about is luckily not limited to just summer camps and schools which is further driving our product and market growth.

To meet this demand we are hiring immediately(and through the year) for:

* Senior Backend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/BE760CF400

* Senior Frontend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/7038D86015

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact
   * Market Competitive Salary
   * Stock options
   * Unlimited vacation policy
   * Fully remote work environment with a flexible work schedule
   * Startup growth and energy

If this interests you or you have questions, please reach out to me via email using the address in my profile and I will be happy to answer anything or you can apply directly via the links above.

For frontend, Angular 6+ on the newer products, and a few mature products leveraging Javascript and JQuery. Many databases to store our 300TB+ of production data including MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, DynamoDB & RDS.

We have some monolithic applications though new products & platforms are built using microservices running Docker containers on AWS ECS with some footprint in Azure.

Amazon Fulfillment Technology | Seattle, Toronto, Austin | Developers, Project Managers, Business Analysts | ONSITE (relocation available) | https://www.amazon.jobs
tl;dr: We make warehouses better. I can help you apply to a team doing cool things you like. My team is cool too.

Amazon Fulfillment Technology (AFT) is the division of Amazon focused on improving and optimizing the Amazon Fulfillment Centers (warehouses). We have teams in Seattle, Toronto and Austin. There are a lot of teams in all three offices working on interesting problems.

My team focuses on using machine learning to predict mismatches between our inventory database (where we think everything is) and reality (where things actually are). This helps ensure that when a customer orders an item they always receive their order on time. We own everything from the prediction, the work scheduling, the user experience for the tools, reporting, the whole problem from end to end.

Throughout my career here I've been mentored by incredible developers. I've always been challenged in terms of technical and personal growth. And despite what some may have said, I've never been mistreated by managers or cried at my desk :)

Want to work on a specific area? I can direct a resume to the right managers/teams. Interested in Amazon, but not Fulfillment? Happy to help you there too. Want to come work for the coolest team in Toronto, applying ML to a real world problem? There's an empty seat beside mine.
Feel free to email me any questions: this username at company name dot com. Or just apply on https://www.amazon.jobs, but that's less interesting.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer &amp; more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: Please be a bit patient when expecting an answer as I'm travelling this week.

Lightning Labs | Frontend Developer, Crypto Protocol Engineer, Dev Ops, Infrastructure | San Francisco | Onsite or Remote | Full-time
https://angel.co/lightning/ https://lightning.engineering/

Lightning Labs is hiring! We’re looking to expand our team to build technology that scales Bitcoin and blockchains. Our current focus is the development and deployment of the Lightning Network, an open blockchain scalability protocol. We push the edge of innovation with regard to blockchain scalability, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX. If you’re interested in one of the positions below, please send a brief description of your relevant experience and resume/github to jobs@lightning.engineering. And if you know someone who might be a good fit, we'd very much appreciate any referrals.

{Crypto Protocol Engineer}:

Experienced systems software engineer versed in applied cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems, open source software, and cryptocurrency protocols to design and implement core protocol and algorithmic components of the Lightning Network. Solid programming skills, experience with Go, C, or C++. Prior contributions to crypto protocols and open source software collaboration preferred.

{Frontend Application Developer}:

Frontend developer to build secure cross-platform second-layer blockchain applications. Our applications are built on React, React Native, MobX, and Electron, communicating with a Lightning daemon over a binary RPC protocol. Ideal applicants will have experience building and shipping React Native applications and maintaining open source projects.

{Infrastructure and Distributed Systems Engineer}:

Systems-oriented engineer to build highly-available, secure systems, lowering the barrier to entry for operating routing nodes and making Lightning more useable in general. Tasks include writing advanced software tooling for automated channel management, initial client channel selection (autopilot), ongoing capital management and optimization, monitoring infrastructure for routing nodes, and creating novel systems for obtaining and managing channel liquidity within the network.

{DevOps Engineer}:
We currently deploy a number of backend services that make Lightning easier to use built on technology such as: etcd, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, and Traefik. Your role would be to help us secure and scale these systems via intelligent automation and robust service architecture. Experience with AWS is a bonus, as well as experience with Bitcoin, particularly in the area of key management.

The Trade Desk | Full Time, Onsite & Remote | New York NY, San Jose CA, San Francisco CA, Irvine CA, Ventura CA, Santa Barbara CA, Boulder CO, Denver CO, Bellevue WA, London UK, Sydney AUS, Shanghai CN
Hiring: Mid/Senior/Lead level software engineers, as well as front-end focused engineers who are comfortable with data-access design, development and optimization.

You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk's dev team if:

You are a full-stack engineer who wants to work everywhere, not just a small subset of components. Experience / interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes: client-side React & Redux, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, many-layered data pipeline (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.) that moves hundreds of thousands of items per second, and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all.

You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#/.Net, but specific experience here is not required.

Cool stuff about TTD:

Our platform processes 10million+ queries per second

Aquabyte | San Francisco, CA | Full Time | Software Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer / Deep Learning Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer | ONSITE, VISA https://jobs.lever.co/aquabyte/
Aquabyte (https://www.aquabyte.ai, backed by NEA and Costanoa, top tier investors) is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.

Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.

OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Adacado | Intermediate and Senior Software Engineers, FE and BE | Vancouver, BC, Canada | Full-time, onsite
You have over 3-5 years of coding and web application expertise, and want to do more innovative development and less mundane operations support.

“Creating Change is what we do.”

Adacado is looking for expert FE and BE programmers (ES6/CSS or Golang) to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically. You’re the type of developer that is never satisfied. You strive to create new technologies/design patterns, and/or completely abandoning current systems and undertaking complete re-builds, using all the latest technology. You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.

“Fail often, fail fast.”

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges. Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, Node and ES6, and utilizes Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch. We manage an ever growing army of microserviceswith special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise. You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis. You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’. You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill. You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues. We value expert specialists over expert generalists.

The Adacado Team

Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit. We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.

We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget. All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit. Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks. We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.

How to Apply

Please send your CV and cover letter to careers@adacado.com, and indicate you are applying from Hacker News.

Narrative I/O | Scala Backend Engineer, Angular Frontend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | http://narrative.io/
Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.

- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.

- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.

- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.

We are hiring for the backend and frontend roles and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.

Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. We are a web-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know.

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past year we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with active Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS or TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area: https://www.tanium.com/apply-now/?gh_jid=1610524&gh_src=d2f26a7e1

Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa:

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Director of Strategic Accounts - We're looking for a number of sales people to fill various roles including, in particular, Director of Strategic Accounts.

These are primarily remote roles, looking for people based in Australia, Belgium, Denmark (or Southern Sweden), France, Germany, Switzerland, the US and the UK.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Sales#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

Frontapp | All Engineering roles | San Francisco, CA and Paris, France | ONSITE
Email is the universal communication tool for work. It’s where you discuss work, answer questions, and talk to all of your customers, vendors, and partners. But email wasn’t made for business and hasn’t evolved with the way you work with a team. So you’re dropping the ball, missing important context, and relying on many siloed apps that make you less productive as a whole.

With more than 5,000 customers and $79 million in funding from Sequoia, DFJ and others, Front is reinventing the inbox so people can accomplish more together. We’ve created one place where you communicate internally and externally, gain context about customers and projects, and access all your other tools so you can be more efficient, more fulfilled, and ultimately happier at work - https://frontapp.com
