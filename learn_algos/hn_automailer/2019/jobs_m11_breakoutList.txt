WHAT IS INTERCOM? 
Intercom is the world’s #1 business messenger and more.
Whether our customers want to do more with less by leaning on our 100+ apps, we help out  customers’ customers self serve with articles and chat bots, or target chat to specific segments Intercom is customer messaging that fits their business. Intercom is also the best team inbox for sales and support AND the leading choice for targeted outbound messages that deliver. Valued at over $1bn, Intercom has been ranked among the best on the Crunchbase unicorn leaderboard since 2018. In our 8 year history, we’ve built world class sales, marketing and R&D functions, and published a number of books along the way (https://www.intercom.com/books).
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK FOR INTERCOM?
Our culture is open and friendly and inclusive - and this is something we are proud of. We are optimistic, passionate and positive. We like people who can stay focused and work hard and who are confident, yet kind and humble. We like to experiment, sometimes inventing things for the first time, but we stay pragmatic, starting small and simple in everything we do. We love people who genuinely want to learn and grow and take bets on high potential engineers on rapid trajectories.
We’re opinionated by default, for example we run LESS software (https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/) and ship continuously (https://www.intercom.com/blog/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/). We’re technically conservative and like to keep it simple (https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/build-boring-software/), but where it means building better products we’ll double down on new technology like machine learning (https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-fergal-reid-ai-machine-learning/) in a pragmatic way.

TECH: Ruby on Rails application with an Ember.js frontend. We use MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon’s DynamoDB for most of our storage. Our web messenger is built on React.
