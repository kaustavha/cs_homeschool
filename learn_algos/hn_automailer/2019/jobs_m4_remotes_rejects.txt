PathAI | Boston, MA or Austin, TX | https://pathai.com | Onsite / Remote (US)
PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to help detect cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.
Check out our open positions at https://www.pathai.com/careers/.

SEEKING FREELANCERS/EMPLOYEES - NYC preferred, but remote quite conceivable
HappyFunCorp (https://happyfuncorp.com) - We're currently seeking:

- good Node, React, Rails, WordPress, and enterprise Azure e-commerce developers, as well as excellent technical project managers. We prefer people with a reasonable amount of experience under their belt, but there are always exceptions.

- a couple of excellent, principal-level, general-specialist software engineers who are comfortable leading tech teams, identifying and solving clients' real (as opposed to reported) problems, architecting solutions from scratch, refactoring existing codebases, putting out occasional fires, and moving fairly seamlessly from one project / language / framework to another.
We do web and app (and occasionally some blockchain) development for a panoply of clients ranging from Fortune 500 to brand-new startups -- right now the distribution is roughly 50-50 -- and we pay well.

ReadCoor | Hardware Software Engineer and Pipeline Software Engineer | Cambridge, MA | ONSITE, REMOTE | https://www.readcoor.com
ReadCoor is a company developing a platform for DNA sequencing in 3D tissue.  We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, chemists, hardware and software engineers building this technology to assist in the next leap of biological research and discovery.

Why 3D Spatial Sequencing?

Current state of the art DNA sequencing will tell you what raw "source code" you have. Various RNA sequencing technologies and recent single cell techniques will give you "runtime configuration" information.  These techniques will tell you what molecules are present in a tissue, but they do not tell you where the molecules are located.

Our sequencing technology maps their location in exquisite detail. We can, for example tell you not just that a virus’s DNA was found in a sample, but also allow you to view the intact tissue and see which individual cells were infected. We apply this technology to all areas of biomedical research including infectious disease, neuroscience, and cancer biology.

Pipeline Software Engineer

Our backend pipeline engineering role is responsible for building and scaling out our ingestion and processing pipeline.

This pipeline uses a lot of python (numpy, scipy, skimage, pandas, dask, zarr to name a few libraries) to process individual tissue samples which range in size from 1-5 TB of images (and growing).

Hardware Software Engineer

Our Hardware Software Engineer is responsible for writing code that enables our automated sequencing platform.

To accomplish this we use python, C++, and JS to control a complex mutli-axis imaging platform with integrated high-precision fluidics.
If interested, please visit https://www.readcoor.com/job-openings to see the Pipeline and Hardware positions.

DocStation | Senior Product Designer | Austin, Denver, REMOTE (US Only) | http://docstation.co
DocStation is a platform that makes it easy for pharmacists to transition away from dispensing pills to providing clinical care for patients. We built the platform with their workflow in mind as opposed to billing requirements, which plagues most of the industry/market. We’re also in a unique position because the majority of the tech innovation has happened at the Hospital/Health System level while pharmacy has been left in the stone age; which is a huge market opportunity as pharmacy starts to catch up.

We receive data from insurance claims on a daily, weekly, monthly cadence that we transform into patient profiles, medication lists, and insights in the UI in order to augment the clinical work of pharmacists to give them time back in their day. We have lots of data at our fingertips and we need your help presenting it to pharmacists so they can take even better care of their patients.

Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:
- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

<Confidential - Energy Sector> | Software / ML Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time
We are a small, profitable, bootstrapped company that applies machine learning (ML) to fluid dynamics (FD) systems.

We are looking for an engineer to work closely with the founder and form the core of our team.

Role

* The FD models are developed by a specialized ML team; they’re evaluated in a simulated environment, where a second ML layer decides agent action based on FD model output.

* Everything except development of the FD models is under the purview of this role.  (You’re absolutely welcome to dive into that; it’s just not a requirement.)

* Minimal bureaucracy: we're a tiny team with existing customers.  We don't have outside investors to persuade.  There's very little friction in going from idea to production.

Responsibilities

* Build data pipelines to request, transform and store data.  (This is a small component of the role.)

* Build (statistical / machine-learned) agent actions based on FD model outputs.

* Develop an event-driven simulation environment to evaluate FD and agent models.

* Work closely with FD team to iterate on FD model based on simulation performance.

* Deploy pipelines and trained FD and agent models into production.  Capture events and model inference.

Skills

* Extensive experience (ideally using Python) to build high-availability, complex systems.

* Intimate familiarity with the Python scientific data stack.

* Experience with "classical" machine learning, such as tree-based models and Bayesian methods.

* Nice-to-have: math or physics background.
We prefer remote candidates in the US or Canada, but would consider those in the UK and the EU.  Write us at confidential.energy@gmail.com.

Hazel Analytics | Data Scientist | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $150K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics is a fast-growing food tech company on a mission to create innovative products that transform the way organizations use food safety data. Founded in 2014 by prominent professors whose careers include decades of research at Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Maryland, we are the proven market leader in health department data analytics, serving nearly half of the largest 100 food retail chains.

Our Food Safety Insights (FSI) platform transforms diffuse and disparate local health department data into actionable intelligence. As a result, our customers — including Amazon, Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, and Whole Foods — can rely on Hazel Analytics technology to proactively monitor food safety and regulatory compliance at over 100,000 locations that serve millions of meals every day in the US and Canada.

Hazel Analytics is a proud recipient of the 2019 Food Marketing Institute Food Safety Innovation Award and the 2016 Jack in the Box Food Safety Innovation Award. We've also had opportunities to be involved in interesting projects such as this recent collaboration with ESPN: http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25316231/health-inspection-reports-find-critical-violations-nfl-nhl-nba-mlb-stadiums-2018-espn-lines

We are profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution.

As a data scientist with Hazel Analytics, you will help identify new opportunities and develop high-impact data analytics, predictive models, and statistical tools that will generate practical and actionable inputs for our user community. You will be expected to be both a creative and critical thinker, have strong judgment in prioritization and execution, and strike a balance between moving quickly and delivering high-trust analytics. Our ideal candidate not only thinks and acts like a leader but also rolls up their sleeves to explore and implement new analytical models.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer &amp; more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.

NoRedInk | Full-Stack, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers| San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

REMOTE (Worldwide) - Open Source Developer on Open edX - React, Python/Django, AWS/OpenStack (OpenCraft - Fully remote company)
Development specialized on the free software project Open edX, used by and in part developed by organizations like MIT, Harvard, McKinsey, and others, so you’ll have the opportunity to contribute to projects that are widely used and to be part of a thriving open source educational community. See edx.org, stanford.edu or fun-mooc.fr for examples of Open edX instances.

We are 27 senior developers, all working remotely from Europe, North & South America, Asia & Australia. The company is not affiliated with edX, but rather contributing and working with them on various projects. This is a full time position, where you would be able to work remotely from anywhere you want, as long as you have a good internet connection. : )

The Open edX platform is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. You would work on different clients contracts using the platform. The clients list/references include Harvard, MIT, edX themselves, the French government, and various startups & universities currently running their own instances, or looking to create one. Tasks are very varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working fullstack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.

Most of your work is published as free software (Open edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing most of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.

We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.

You can read more about how we work in our handbook, at https://handbook.opencraft.com/

Stack: Python/Django, Ansible, AWS/OpenStack, React, Debian/Ubuntu, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Elasticsearch, JS, HTML/CSS.

Nice to haves: Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker, Android/iOS. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.

Interview process: a 30 minutes Hangout with a (simple) coding exercise.
To apply, fill this form: https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/

The Trade Desk | Full Time, Onsite & Remote | Chicago IL, New York NY, San Jose CA, San Francisco CA, Aliso Viejo CA, Ventura CA, Boulder CO, Denver CO, Bellevue WA, Seattle WA, London UK, Sydney AUS, Shanghai CN
Hiring: Senior Software Engineers, as well as Senior Front-End focused engineers who are comfortable with data-access design, development and optimization.

You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk's dev team if:

You are a full-stack engineer who wants to work everywhere, not just a small subset of components. Experience / interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes: client-side React & Redux, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, many-layered data pipeline (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.) that moves hundreds of thousands of items per second, and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all.

 You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#/.Net, but specific experience here is not required.

Cool stuff about TTD:

* Our platform processes 9million+ queries per second

* Work with the best engineering team in AdTech

* The combination of huge data sets, high throughput, low latency and amazing scale means that we're constantly solving some of the biggest challenges in computer science.

* We've grown faster than any other adtech company in the industry, and have been recently recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in America by Inc. Magazine and Deloitte.

* Amazing Company Culture

* Top-tier benefits

If you're interested, please apply directly on our website: https://www.thetradedesk.com/join-us/open-positions
*Note: We are actively hiring a Senior Lead Engineer in Chicago who will assist us in building out Engineering presence in Chicago. We are also hiring Senior Solutions Architects in NYC (must have engineering background), as well as Site Reliability Engineers (globally), Programmer Analysts (globally), Product Managers (globally), Application Support Coordinators & Analysts (globally), Data Scientists (globally), and Business Intelligence Analysts (globally)

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

Engineering Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area.

US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa.

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

Waldo Photos | Senior Software Engineers, Intern/Junior Engineer  | Full-Time | Austin, TX or REMOTE (Globally)
Waldo Photos (https://waldophotos.com/) is a photo finding platform utilizing facial and object recognition to empower consumers to toss their selfie sticks, put their phones back in their pockets and live in the moment. Waldo is the only platform that removes all of the friction in getting photos of you taken by others and creates new opportunities for photographers to market and sell their photos. Users can enjoy life’s most precious events and automatically receive images taken of them right on their phones or share images of others they’ve taken without having to lift a finger – whether between friends and family or a professional photographer.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself. And while camps and schools have been the first areas that Waldo has gained traction, the challenge of matching and delivery of the photos you care about is luckily not limited to just summer camps and schools which is further driving our product and market growth.

To meet this demand we are hiring immediately(and through the year) for:

* Senior Backend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/BE760CF400

* Senior Frontend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/7038D86015

* Junior/Intern Software Engineer (must be in Austin, TX) : We don't have a public posting for this right now, but if you have interest please reach out to me directly. This position will be doing production troubleshooting with GraphQL, SQL, Logs, etc as well as building internal tools and automated testing based on your production experience

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact
   * Market Competitive Salary
   * Stock options
   * Unlimited vacation policy
   * Fully remote work environment with a flexible work schedule
   * Startup growth and energy


If this interests you or you have questions, please reach out to me via email using the address in my profile and I will be happy to answer anything. Or you can apply directly via the links above or just send me your resume and which job you are interested in.
