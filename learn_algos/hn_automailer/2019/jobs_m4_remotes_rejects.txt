- Rails Experience - Our platform runs on Rails. You should have Rails experience and be able to have an intelligent conversation about Rails.

- containers/kubernetes?- We're curious if our business would be a fit for a straight-up kubernetes migration. If you can help us assess if that migration makes sense, define a plan, and implement it, you're looking at an easy second project.

If this sounds like something you'd be able to help with, then send an email to me (Jack) at jahodges419 - at - gmail.com and tell me:

- Why you think you'd be a good fit to help us

- A project you worked on that showcases your Automation Expertise (just a few sentences)

SEEKING FREELANCERS/EMPLOYEES - NYC preferred, but remote quite conceivable
HappyFunCorp (https://happyfuncorp.com) - We're currently seeking:

- good Rails, React, WordPress, and .NET developers, as well as excellent technical project managers. We prefer people with a reasonable amount of experience under their belt, but there are always exceptions.

- a couple of excellent, principal-level, general-specialist software engineers who are comfortable leading tech teams, helping to identify and solve clients' real (as opposed to reported) problems, architecting solutions from scratch, refactoring existing codebases, putting out occasional fires, and moving fairly seamlessly from one project / language / framework to another.
We do web and app (and occasionally some blockchain) development for a panoply of clients ranging from Fortune 500 to brand-new startups -- right now the distribution is roughly 50-50 -- and we pay well.

Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | ONSITE/REMOTE, Full-time | https://www.thanx.com/careers/job/1466586/
Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a physical store. Data is king. Online  it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.
In a nutshell, Thanx ingests data, provides insights, enables actions to drive growth in the business. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital), to name a few.
Thanx Engineering
Yes, we have an app you can download. The power of Thanx is massively scalable data pipelines, microservices that power four 9s uptime, intelligent purchase normalization, and matching algorithms  — we don’t show that stuff off publicly.
Here’s more on who we are:

• Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from startups and successful product companies like Google, Facebook, Intuit, Disney. This is an elite Eng team, period.

• Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform.

• Tech: scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency backend systems; beautiful, performant, responsive UIs; user-friendly mobile apps.
• Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing, and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours.

Our long term goal is to become a one-stop solution to assist drivers with their automotive related challenges. This includes helping drivers finding the best price on auto insurance, leasing & financing options, mechanics etc. We've bootstrapped the company and have dismissed over $10 million worth of fines.
Our team: We are a small development team with members who take on multiple roles across the stack. We strive to always be improving our process and code bases, to use the correct tools for the tasks at hand, and to help grow our collective skills.

Your Role: We’re looking for a full-stack engineer driven to solve challenging problems with a clean and maintainable approach. You will write modular, high-quality code while actively contributing to peer code reviews. You are an intelligent, passionate, and innovative developer that can formulate new ideas and execute them within an existing development environment. Ideally, you enjoy a hands on approach in determining how you and the team can develop technology to meet the company’s business needs.

Skills: We’re seeking developers with full stack skills and experience. Our primary web application is written in Angular, however, we consider ourselves to be a React team. We’re developing new projects in React, and are actively transitioning our web app to React as well. We use Node.js on the backend, with MongoDB as the datastore for our primary products.

Experience: Ideally you have previous startup experience, writing production level code, or experience deploying your own projects to a userbase.

Waldo Photos | Senior Software Engineers  | Full-Time | Austin, TX  or REMOTE (Globally)
Waldo Photos (https://waldophotos.com/) is a photo finding platform utilizing facial and object recognition to empower consumers to toss their selfie sticks, put their phones back in their pockets and live in the moment. Waldo is the only platform that removes all of the friction in getting photos of you taken by others and creates new opportunities for photographers to market and sell their photos. Users can enjoy life’s most precious events and automatically receive images taken of them right on their phones or share images of others they’ve taken without having to lift a finger – whether between friends and family or a professional photographer.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself. And while camps and schools have been the first areas that Waldo has gained traction, the challenge of matching and delivery of the photos you care about is luckily not limited to just summer camps and schools which is further driving our product and market growth.

To meet this demand we are hiring immediately(and through the year) for:

* Senior Backend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/BE760CF400

* Senior Frontend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/7038D86015

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact
   * Market Competitive Salary
   * Stock options
   * Unlimited vacation policy
   * Fully remote work environment with a flexible work schedule
   * Startup growth and energy

If this interests you or you have questions, please reach out to me via email using the address in my profile and I will be happy to answer anything or you can apply directly via the links above.

<still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see each position).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer & more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4-5months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a lead/managerial role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)
More keywords for the CTRL+F'ers ;) : F#, C#, Xamarin, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, blockchain, smart contracts, stable coins, MakerDAO/DAI, etc.

Solar United Neighbors | IT Generalist | Full-time | Washington, DC | ONSITE or REMOTE | https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org
Women, minorities, people with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

Solar United Neighbors is a national nonprofit that organizes local communities around the country to go solar, join together, and fight for their energy rights.

We’re growing fast -- really fast. We’re expanding into new states, building new partnerships, and offering new services. That kind of growth requires a great IT infrastructure to help our members and supporters organize and advocate for solar at the state and national level. Your job is to help build the infrastructure that powers our growth.

IN THE FIRST YEAR, you can expect to work on projects that include:

- Work with our Go Solar team to CUSTOMIZE SALESFORCE to support new product lines and workflows, streamline their workload, and increase our ability to report on campaign performance.

- UPGRADE OUR COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (mass email, advocacy, event management, donations) to a more effective and flexible system (or systems) and integrate them with both our websites and with SalesForce.

- Work with our Growth team to REBUILD OUR WEBSITES to be more user-friendly, accessible, and effective at engaging our community of solar supporters.

- Work with our Engagement Director to DEVELOP WEB APPLICATIONS that automate the internal workflow for our two major national solar awareness campaigns -- Brews from the Sun and the National Solar Tour.

We’ve gone all-in with WordPress for our websites, so you need to know your way around WORDPRESS (and PHP in general) really well. Most of our core business logic lives in SALESFORCE, so you need to know how to customize SalesForce (custom objects, reports, workflows). Deploying and managing the servers will be your responsibility, so you need to be effective on the LINUX command line. And we have some data analysis projects on deck, so you need to be comfortable setting up DATABASES and writing SQL queries.

Just as important as all those technical skills -- maybe more! -- you need to be a COMMITTED TEAM PLAYER who is ready to shoulder responsibility, find the opportunity hidden in every problem, and build other people up.

Finally, you need to bring a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. We’re huge fans of applying the LEAN STARTUP model to our work -- building quick prototypes to test our ideas in the real world, collecting data to measure how well those ideas perform, and learning from that data so we can make the next version even better.

NoRedInk |Full-Stack Engineers,Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Engineering Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area.

US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

REMOTE (Worldwide) - Open Source Developer on Open edX - React, Python/Django, AWS/OpenStack (OpenCraft - Fully remote company)
Development specialized on the free software project Open edX, used by and in part developed by organizations like MIT, Harvard, McKinsey, and others, so you’ll have the opportunity to contribute to projects that are widely used and to be part of a thriving open source educational community. See edx.org, stanford.edu or fun-mooc.fr for examples of Open edX instances.

We are 27 senior developers, all working remotely from Europe, North & South America, Asia & Australia. The company is not affiliated with edX, but rather contributing and working with them on various projects. This is a full time position, where you would be able to work remotely from anywhere you want, as long as you have a good internet connection. : )

The Open edX platform is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. You would work on different clients contracts using the platform. The clients list/references include Harvard, MIT, edX themselves, the French government, and various startups & universities currently running their own instances, or looking to create one. Tasks are very varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working fullstack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.

Most of your work is published as free software (Open edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing most of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.

We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.

You can read more about how we work in our handbook, at https://handbook.opencraft.com/

Stack: Python/Django, Ansible, AWS/OpenStack, React, Debian/Ubuntu, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Elasticsearch, JS, HTML/CSS.

Nice to haves: Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker, Android/iOS. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.

Interview process: a 30 minutes Hangout with a (simple) coding exercise.
To apply, fill this form: https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/
