University of Michigan | Ann Arbor, MI | Full-Time | Onsite | $52-$68khttp://careers.umich.edu/job_detail/176986/research_support_programmer_intermediateassociate
 My team is hiring a junior/intermediate Research Support Programmer. We are setup as an internal consulting service for the college of LSA that takes any programming job a research lab needs help with. If you think of yourself as a “web developer” or a “python programmer” then this might not be for you. We are looking for someone ready to learn/write/debug whatever the labs need. In the first few years, this will include working with a lot of new languages and technologies.
We are especially interested in adding someone who has experience/interest in interfacing with research hardware: Imagine a researcher just bought a big micro-fluidics machine and a microscope and needs to automate taking images during an experiment. We would be particularly excited to get a LabVIEW fan.

You can email me with informal questions, but the only way to apply is through the link above at the umich careers site.
Note that this job listing ends soon and my close as early as the 6th

newline (formerly Fullstack.io) | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.newline.co/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.
- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.
- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, Blazor etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

We're a non-profit AI research lab. Our goal is to make machine learning solve tasks where success can’t be reduced to a simple metric. We're working towards a future where ML is as helpful for open-ended questions like “Should I get this medical procedure?” and “What career is right for me” as it is for optimizing ad click-through rates.

The core pillar of our research is Mosaic, an app for decomposing thinking about hard questions into small subtasks. We compositionally build complex thoughts out of simple pieces. We want to get to the point where automated aggregation of individual thoughts leads to something that is more than the sum of the pieces.

Humboldt talked about natural language as a system that "makes infinite use of finite means" -- an infinite number of sentences can be created using a finite number of grammatical rules. As engineering team lead at Ought, you're working on mechanisms that have similar flexible compositionality.

Stack: Our work is back-end-heavy Ruby on Rails and we use PostgreSQL as our data store. We use a bit of Vue.js but believe server-side rendering is still the best default.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby.

You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Unnamed Seed Stage Startup | Founding Engineer OR Founding Design/Product Role | Remote and Bay Area | Full Time
We are a new startup in the UX design tool space, with a mission to radically lower the barriers needed to build full-fidelity prototypes and products—something currently accessible only to a tiny and privileged sub-population (developers).  The stage is very early, pre-product, but we have enthusiastic early feedback.

The team of four has three ex-founders.  We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.

We received strong (outlier) funding offers from a number of top tier VCs.  We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of amazing angels/funds, including leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer.  No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.
If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com.  Thanks, we're excited to hear from you!

FLOWER CO. (YC W19) | 1st Product Designer | FT in Los Angeles | https://flowercompany.com
FLOWER CO. is a wholesale cannabis membership club that saves consumers 40% on their favorite products and brands. We are hiring our first Product Designer!

The California cannabis market is $10 billion dollars of which $8 billion is still illicit. With taxes as high as 40%+ in cities like Los Angeles, consumers have little reason to participate in the regulated market. We seek to change this. Thanks to our membership program, scheduled delivery model (not on-demand), and our access to Humboldt County supply, we beat the illicit market on price.

PS: Veterans and YC founders both get free lifetime memberships ($119/year normally!).

https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.
