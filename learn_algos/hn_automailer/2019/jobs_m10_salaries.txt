Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.

We received strong funding offers from a number of top tier VCs. We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of esteemed angels/funds, including well-known leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer. No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Lead | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/611/full-stack-software-engineer/

We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly.

newline (formerly Fullstack.io) | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.newline.co/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps. - We guarantee the books and code are up to date.
- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)
- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, Angular, React, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Elixir, Blazor, Data Science etc. Anything up and coming.

Harvard Library Innovation Lab | Web Developer | Cambridge, MA | Onsite, Full-time
The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is hiring a lead developer for opencasebook.org, our free, Creative-Commons-licensed legal textbook publishing platform.

About the project: opencasebook.org democratizes access to legal education by replacing $200 textbooks with free, forkable, digital or print-on-demand alternatives. We’re used in law classes at Harvard Law School and elsewhere; our website and code are open and available to anyone in the world. We’ve saved students over $1 million in textbook costs and have the potential for orders of magnitude more.

About the team: LIL is a group of ~10 developers/designers/lawyers/librarians building projects for systemic change, based out of the Harvard Law School Library. Our other projects include case.law, an open database of 360 years of precedential American caselaw; perma.cc, which fights link rot in court decisions and law review articles; and the Nuremberg Project, digitizing one of only two copies of the full evidence record from the WW2 Nuremberg trials. We’ve done side projects on distributed encryption, crowd-sourced fair use advice, interactive art installations, and more.

About you: this is a great fit for a more experienced developer (like me!) who is looking for a low-stress job with high social impact and great opportunities for personal growth. We use Django and Vue, so you should either have experience with those or with getting up to speed on new things. We are a very small team, so you should be prepared to contribute across the stack and to be very self-directed about what you work on day to day.

Personal opportunities: Another programmer here recently described this as the “most human” place she ever worked, and I feel the same way — we’re a small group from a lot of different backgrounds with wide scope to do creative work, so we place a lot of emphasis on making sure everyone has what they need while they’re working here. We each have real support to pursue experiments drawing on our own experience and enthusiasm, whether that’s exploring side projects, taking classes at Harvard, teaching classes at Harvard, making art projects, organizing conferences, advocacy, etc. Many of us have done more than one of these, and we’re serious about maintaining both a work/life balance and an exploration/exploitation balance within our work.

Job page with application link at the bottom: https://lil.law.harvard.edu/collaborate/2019/h2o-developer/

—
(This is a weird one! There aren't many programming jobs, even academic jobs, that pay a steady salary to creatively pursue social impact with a broad, self-directed scope like this. It's an awesome job for the right person -- please pass it along if you think you know that person!)
