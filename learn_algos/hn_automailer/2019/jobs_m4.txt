Root | Columbus, OH | Full-time | Onsite / partial remote | $80k-$150k |
https://root.engineering/

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 500 people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone. So, you're in luck.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.
Email us at either chris.evans@joinroot.com or tim.hill@joinroot.com to apply and we'll respond to you promptly.

Teller makes banking APIs for developers that provide real time access to live, up-to-date data from their users' accounts and also allow instant payment initiation and transfers on behalf of users.

Our approach is unique in that we don't screenscrape online banking portals, we reverse engineer the bank's often heavily protected mobile app to discover its private API contract and implement our own API compatible clients.

Roles we are currently hiring for:

- Designer #1

Are you the kind of designer talented enough to walk on to Stripe's design team but want to have the impact of being designer #1 not #100? We would love to talk to you.

- Reverse Engineering (iOS)

We pop open some of the most well protected mobile apps in the world as a prerequisite to integrating a new bank. If you have a more sophisticated answer than "MITMProxy" for the question "How would you reverse a banking app's API contract?" please get in touch.

We're working on some exciting projects like our own lldb debugserver undetectable by state-of-the-art anti-RE tools and static decryption of Apple's FairPlay DRM. We strongly believe investing in proprietary tooling is major advantage.

- Erlang/Elixir Engineers

Our application is 100% Elixir. We really mean it. We are 100% all in on Elixir, we've even already started building new features with Phoenix LiveView.

- iOS Engineers

We're looking for a great iOS engineer to build a beautiful iOS SDK for our API, and to also work on a secret skunkworks project.

- DevRel/DevX Engineering

Do you think DevRel has jumped the shark and needs a reboot? Same here. This role involves a mixture of core engineering, being a user advocate within the company, creating great content and tooling for the best possible developer experience.

SWAT | Junior Software Engineer | Singapore | Onsite | Fulltime
We help companies provide more efficient transportation for their employees by figuring out routes that minimize travel duration, and provide greater insight for both operators and passengers.

I personally joined the company for two reasons. First, I knew the founder to be a solid software engineer and caring/honest person. Second, I've seen first hand how soul crushing long commutes can be for people who don't live near public transportation and/or work strange hours (and how this problem overwhelmingly impacts the poor).

We're looking for junior backend and frontend developers. Frontend is in React. Backend is in Go, but we're starting to move components over to Elixir. Prior experience in these specific technologies isn't a requirement. Questions / resumes can be sent to karl@swatmobile.io

Tezos (Nomadic Labs) | Technical Writer, Release Engineer | Paris, FR | ONSITE
Tezos is a top-20 cryptocurrency project with a focus on on-chain governance and security.  We're a decentralized ecosystem with multiple entities working together toward a common goal.

Among other hiring needs (in NYC, Paris, Europe-generally, etc.), we're particularly interested two roles for Paris 1) a great technical writer/documentation and training developer to help build some really good developer, integrator, and end user documentation; 2) a release engineer to manage building/packaging/testing of our core software (in OCaml).  We're also constantly hiring (mainly PhD) OCaml developers and other technical roles, but we've got a more solid pipeline of those people -- tech writer, training development, and release engineering less so so far.

Compensation/etc. is "market".  Perk: you get to work with a ~35 person team with ~22 CS PhDs, great ties to French academic institutions, etc., and a beautiful office in Paris (with private offices, with doors).  Open source software, lots of opportunity to learn/grow your career and network.

Speaking French is helpful (socially, since you're in Paris), but you can get by professionally in English-only if you'd like (but you probably want to learn French, at least for the great restaurants).

We'd like this to be ONSITE in Paris, but there is travel to NYC/Zurich/etc. as you wish.  Happy to help with relo, visa, etc. as needed (EU person is probably easier, but for the right people we'd hire globally for someone who wants to be in Paris).
For more information please contact me at ryan.lackey@tezos.com and I'll put you in touch with the hiring manager, or answer preliminary questions.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. Almost a year ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Zoba is a platform for analyzing, visualizing, and optimizing spatial data. Our mission is to “improve the efficiency of cities and the lives of people that live in them.” Right now, our customers are primarily (micro)mobility companies interested in questions like “where should we place our vehicles” and “how should we rebalance our fleet?”

- Sane working hours (e.g. since I joined last fall, I’ve yet to work a single night or weekend, though it may happen eventually)

- Unlimited vacation policy, with a suggested minimum number of days (to avoid the slide to people trying to be tough by taking 0 days)

- Roughly biweekly seminars on team members’ interests, typically not directly work related

- Weekly team lunches

- Have plenty of runway and backed by excellent investors including CRV, Founder Collective, Mark Cuban, and Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Bagel Health (YC W19) First employee (Full-stack engineer) REMOTE
Work at a YC startup trying to fix healthcare! Bagel is a new electronic health record for the growing direct primary care (DPC) movement. Read more about DPC at dpcnation.org. DPC cuts insurance out of primary care. It makes no sense to use insurance to pay for basic or routine medical services; do you use your car insurance to pay for an oil change? There are some seriously great knock-on benefits of getting rid of insurance too.

Looking for someone who is willing to work below market (roughly ~$60k annualized) until we raise money in 6 months or so. Then the compensation can increase to market rates. Compensation also includes very generous first-employee equity (~4%, standard vesting)

We're still in the early stages of implementation. You'll have a lot of responsibility over software design and architecture decisions.

Here's the tentative stack: Typescript, React, Postgres, Express, Google Cloud, and some Neo4j sprinkled in. Don't worry if you haven't used Neo4j before. Ideally you'd be awesome at a few of these and competent in the rest.
I'm Colin McDonnell, MIT grad, software engineer, the sole founder of Bagel, and nice person. If you're interested in working together, email me at colin(at)bagel(dot)md with a resume and a bit about you and why you're interested!

Halleman Bradley | Los Angeles, CA | Onsite | https://www.hmbradley.com At Halleman Bradley we're building a Full-Stack bank for the next 100 years (Yes, I said 100) and we're going about it in a very different way than most of what you've seen from the other US "Challenger Banks".
We're excited about helping customers save more money, not just encouraging them to spend it all and we're on a truly egalitarian mission. We believe that our users should earn status not by how much money is in their account but by how much of their income they are saving every month.

On the engineering side we're working on a great Stack. Go for the Backend, React for the Front-end and React-Native on Mobile. We're incredibly excited about the progress we've made as a team of 4 but we're already growing (Number 5 agreed last night!).

If you've ever wondered why banking has to be the way it is (hint: It's tradition mostly) then come help us build it the way we think it should be.

We've got an ambitious plan that will take time to iterate on but with the right people and the right drive we believe we can achieve the impossible.
Feel free to reach out to me directly if you want to chat and I'm happy to tell you more: zach [at] hmbradley [dot] com

We are building an intelligent, focused platform that facilitates automated communication between healthcare organizations and their consumers.

Curebase | Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | ONSITE
Biomedical R&D is at an all-time high, but clinical trials are still expensive, slow, and traditional. The reason is the limited pool of research hospitals which R&D sponsors (like pharmaceutical companies) can use to run their trials. The overhead and training required to do research constrains the supply of these research hospitals, and leads to massive inefficiency.

Curebase takes a new approach. We empower every physician to be a researcher with streamlined software. This lets us run any trial in parallel, and enables sponsors to bring their inventions to market faster than ever.

Today, we use our growing physician network to power studies in many exciting areas of medicine, such as smoking cessation, STD testing, and nutrition. We have also participated in Y Combinator S18 and raised $2.5MM in seed funding.
I'm looking for self-motivated, generalist web engineers to join us early. If meaningful ownership of a healthcare product and helping to define an engineering culture sound interesting to you, please email me directly via matt (at) curebase.com, or read more and apply at https://angel.co/curebase/jobs/

Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.
We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 9 people: 4 engineers, 1 designer and 4 others. I’m one of those 4 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!
Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.

We are still a small team, so your work will have an immediate and real impact.  You also won't be stuck with a routine - we touch many types of systems and problems, so raw capability is more important than direct experience.  What can you do over what have you done is what matters most.

Devops: https://abine.breezy.hr/p/9fcce0a83b58-devops-engineer-sysadmin

Valitor Denmark | Hiring in Copenhagen, Denmark | Fulltime, preferably onsite
We're hiring front-end, back-end, and full-stack Java and PHP developers, at least 5 positions to be filled. We're a payment service provider [1]. Our business is booming and we need more code than we can presently type! I've linked [2] to an earlier job posting that's still quite representative. Of course we do agile (currently one scrum team, one kanban team) and run our stuff on Linux, and of course you'll get an ergo desk and a laptop and two large displays. On the coding discipline side, you'll see lots of unit and CI testing, peer work and code reviews.
[1]
We provide the secure "enter your credit card details" page that you get to after checking out your cart at a website; and the endpoint that a physical credit card terminal connects to; we then resolve both of these with the appropriate acquirer and make sure money gets to where it's supposed to go

What we do actually matters.

It's estimated that 250,000 people die in America annually because of medical errors. That makes it the #3 cause of death, just behind heart disease and cancer ( https://goo.gl/zntNUd ).

This is CareEvolution's mission - to create better patient outcomes by modernizing - and connecting - our health IT systems.

We're a small team - still under 100 people (and all technical!) - but our platform manages health data for over 130 million people.

We're looking for people with experience in some of the following: EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, ELB, EBS.  A more complete picture of job qualifications can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/249670/aws-devops-engineer-for-healthcare-software-careevolution

Rover.io | Toronto, Canada | Senior Android Developer | Onsite (partial remote), Full-time | https://www.rover.io/
Our product is a design tool that allows a customer to build visual content in a manner somewhat evocative of Sketch, and then we have mobile SDKs (Android and iOS) that can render all of that natively (not using a WebView).

Here's a video of the design tool running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpQhfl_5gfM

Most of our clients are major sports teams, primarily in the NHL, NFL, NBA, and a few others, but we aren’t specifically a sports product.

Our backend tech stack is mostly microservices, powered by Kubernetes, Go, Node, Mongo, Postgres, GRPC, Redux, and GraphQL and a few other things.

We’re looking for someone to be primarily responsible for the Android SDK going forward.

Codebase (Kotlin, except for some bundled third party libraries) is here: https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android
Contact: Please drop me a line at andrew@rover.io.

FlowCommand (YC W16) | Full-Stack Engineer, Data Engineer, Sensor Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | $120k - $150k + 0.5% - 1.0% | https://angel.co/flowcommand
FlowCommand builds a new type of sensor and software system to monitor fluid infrastructure around the world for leaks, theft, spills, and performance. Fleets of our proprietary lightweight hardware generate raw acoustic data and then send that data directly to our server via cellular/satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed) in pipes.

A few upcoming projects:

We’re planning to send a robotic submarine 10,000 ft underwater to attach our sensors to pipelines sitting on the ocean floor, with the goal of detecting and stopping oil leaks that harm marine wildlife. Build the application that allows operators to monitor their pipeline for leaks and alert them to an impending environmental disaster.

Our Houston office has a remotely operable flow loop (ie an obstacle course for fluids) that allows us to approximate field conditions and gather raw acoustic data. The digital signal processing specialists who write our firmware need to capture test data, but the sensor processes millions of measurements per second, making it difficult to store and process the test data. Build a system that allows them to efficiently test their latest DSP algorithms under a variety of flow conditions.
Technologies we currently use:
Web Apps: Python, Django, React 
Data Pipeline: pandas, scikit-learn, Heroku/AWS 
Sensor Firmware: C++, System VerilogPlease reach out at jobs@flowcommand.com

Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

Steady Health | Software Engineer & Product Designer | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | Onsite
Managing your diabetes well can be the difference between a long, healthy life and heart attack, cardiovascular disease, amputations, and blindness. Today, diabetes care is based on guidelines that are the same for everyone, regardless of motivation, lifestyle and other individual factors.
Steady Health (https://steady.health) is changing diabetes care by leveraging a new technology and dataset, continuous glucose monitors. These sensors let patients track their levels throughout the day without pricking their fingers with complex equipment. We’re building an entirely new clinic experience that use data analysis to help patients understand how diet, physical activity, and medication is impacting their blood sugar levels.

I’m an experienced founder who previously sold a company to Dropbox. My co-founder is an MD who specializes in internal medicine. I’ve also been diabetic for 18 years so between us we know both the patient, and care side, really well.

We're looking for passionate people with a low ego and a drive to learn. Our first clinic will be in San Francisco and we are currently building out our founding engineering and care teams. The company is backed by top funds and angels including former Dropbox CTO, FBs first female engineer and Head of Data Science at Airbnb.
Come and change an important piece of health care with us, email me at henrik@steady.health and read my story https://medium.com/south-park-commons/the-wearable-that-changed-my-life-1a5b9bdbab22

We intend on staying a remote-first team, but we're also trying to start a small Ann Arbor office if we can find the right person to join me here. Having a physical presence in a2 will allow us to hire interns/juniors and mentor them and such, which is more difficult to do remotely.

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, numpy/scipy/pandas/scikit-learn, Dramatiq, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

Darkstore | Multiple roles in Engineering, Product Management, & Design | Full Time | San Francisco | Onsite
Darkstore is changing the way ecommerce products are delivered. Fulfillment and logistics is complicated, which is why we started Darkstore to make it simple and easy. We've created a nationwide logistics network to enable same-day delivery of products for companies like Nike.

Darkstore works by exploiting excess capacity in storage facilities, malls and bodegas and enables them to be fulfillment centers with just a smartphone. The idea is that brands without local inventory can store it in a Darkstore and then ship out same-day. Darkstore charges brands across three areas: fulfillment, storage and delivery.

We closed a $7.5M Series A in January 2019 and are hiring multiple people for Eng, Product, & Design.
If you're interested, please apply here: https://jobs.lever.co/darkstore?lever-via=N-sw6B_q5A

Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/ Positions: Full-Stack Engineer, Data Scientists, R&D Product Formulator / Scientist
Overview: Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception of flavor, aroma, and texture to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products, enter new markets, and optimize their existing brands. We're a diverse 12 person post Series-A startup.
Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, Java, GraphQL, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS

The Position(s)

_Data Science_: We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. Our Data Science team develops new models and algorithms from scratch to make second-order inference on sparse data sets from non-representative samples that generalizes to the underlying target population. We rely on cutting edge models such as persistent homology, PU Learning, and metric learning to make predictions on non-eucldian human sensory data. We don't use tensor flow or pandas or keras as they are not a good fit for our problem space. We prefer a deep understanding of math and stats VS experience running logistic regressions in Python. (but we're cool with Python / Logit / experience)

_Engineering_: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Data-Engineers with experiance in micro-batch processing for machine learning pipelines.
Next Steps: please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

The project

Modern genome engineering technologies have enabled the rapid and precise editing of DNA, causing a paradigm shift in biotechnology: with the focus shifted from reading to writing genetic information, which of the three billion DNA letters in a human cell need to be rewritten in order to prevent disease, live longer, or encode entirely novel features?

The project we are hiring you for is about building a web-based application for computational aided design of cells. Communicating with biological knowledge bases and mathematical models (mechanistic and AI-based), the platform will guide engineers in writing the right DNA based on the entire computable knowledge available for a cell.

The job

We are looking for a full-stack developer. You will be dealing with biological concepts every day, discovering the best user experience for interacting with DNA and its encoded information. Deep understanding of biology is not a requirement though, most of the developers in the institute were able to gain the necessary knowledge after joining our team.

Our technology stack at the moment is:

- Angular, Angular Material, Typescript

- Python3.6 for the backend services (Flask, celery, etc.) and core scientific libraries

- Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j

- Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana

- Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform (GKE, Cloud SQL, Container Registry)

AWS RDS SQL Server moonjo@amazon.com
I hope all is well, reaching out with an opportunity to attend an accelerated hiring event for the Relational Database Service (RDS) for SQL Server team. The team has positions available in Seattle/Bellevue as well as Denver, CO. This event will provide you with an opportunity to join this team through an abbreviated interview process!
Amazon RDS SQL Server’s Manager - Adam Kane ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-kane-43784372/ ) asked me to reach out to you based on your strong background and relevant industry experience in software development.

Our Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is one of the largest cloud database businesses, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are handled in an automated fashion by our control systems. Providing such simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. The systems we build manage huge numbers of databases and vast amounts of storage across multiple data-centers world-wide, and our service is growing rapidly, requiring constant innovations in our systems in order to handle the next order of magnitude in service scale. You can find some more info on what we’re doing across RDS SQL Server here ( https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/ ).

We will be hosting the accelerated hiring event in our Denver office on Friday 4/26. Instead of a technical phone interview I can send over a coding assessment as the first step in the process. If you are able to complete the assessment with a passing score you will be invited to the event for an abbreviated on-site interview.
Please let me know if you’d like me to send over the coding assessment ASAP, the interview slots are filling up quickly!

BitMEX | San Francisco | Onsite |Full-time| Kuberentes, Node, Mobile
BitMEX is a cryptocurrency P2P trading platform offering unrivaled liquidity, security, and career opportunities. Our platform was developed by ex-bankers who were (and are) well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance. BitMEX launched in 2014 and subsequently has grown to become one of the most important marketplaces in the crypto space. n a pulldown menu of “What industry are you in?” it is certainly fair to label BitMEX a fintech company. But we feel like the word “fintech” doesn’t do justice to the uniqueness or grandeur of what we’re building.

Our ambition is to be the pre-eminent futures market for the major crypto-coins (including new ones, as they arrive on the scene), and BitMEX is already is one of the most significant price discovery mechanisms for Bitcoin, which is the most established digital currency so far.

And since Bitcoin may yet turn out to be a civilisation-saving monetary instrument — mankind’s ultimate store of value — history may come to reveal that BitMEX’s trading platform played a crucial role in saving the world. Or, it might just unfold that Bitcoin is a helluva lot of fun for awhile, before petering out or blowing up for some unforeseen reason. Both scenarios are logically imaginable (to use the phrase, from another context, of Hungarian philosopher Tibor Machan).

One way or another, Bitcoin is the defining technology of our current era. And if you work at BitMEX, you will have been part of Bitcoin in the most essential and extreme possible way.
Our top positions right now are:
Mobile Engineer: https://grnh.se/ea3714a82
Kubernetes Engineer: https://grnh.se/57ca65ef2
API Engineer: https://grnh.se/499fb4222If you are interested, please apply to the position you believe you are best suited for and we will get back to you ASAP.

AWS is cloud company. You've probably heard of us. Although it’s a large organization it’s made up of lots of small product teams. We are a 2-pizza team building a new AWS product we are going to be launching later this year. We need a few more folks to help us launch. Unfortunately we’re pretty secretive about new products so we can’t share too many details about the product with you yet. What we can say is that we're part of the AI division and, as you might guess from the job title, the product involves web technologies. We expect this product to have a huge impact on the entire AWS ecosystem.

In your role you’ll focus on building our web app, but you’ll be expected to act like a startup member and participate in every aspect of creating a great product. That includes innovating, designing, prototyping, developing, testing, deploying and operating this new AWS product. You’ll learn about Amazon’s peculiar culture and internal processes. Our web app is built using common web technology including React/Redux/GraphQL, and Webpack.

Our team is split between Seattle, WA and Vancouver, BC. You can choose to work in either place. Feel free to reach out to me directly at vikhyak@amazon.com if you have any questions or if you'd like to learn more. Alternately you can apply directly here:

1.) Phone screen for resume

2.) Short take-home problem

3.) Phone conversation about take-home

4.) Onsite with us

Odds and ends: mostly onsite in lovely downtown San Mateo but flexible hours. Free lunch, ~25 employees, growing in a field that really affects people's lives. Diverse work environment with good, friendly people.
Please apply at https://www.lumiata.com/careers.html and contact hr at lumiata.com with any questions.

Ann Arbor, MI and Columbus, OH | ONSITE To apply, please use either my email address, aclark@nexient.com OR https://www.nexient.com/careers
----- My take -----
(I'm a Sysadmin / DevOps person, I'm not HR or recruitment, but my posting here has been approved by the recruiting dept.)

Nexient are good people: My experience at Nexient has been overwhelmingly positive, they are flexible, caring and fun to work at. They actually care about the life/work balance too. Multiple tabletop, D&D, console gaming nights are organized all the time. Charity drives and other ways to give are also promoted within the company. The work environment is really nice too, with motorized standing/sitting desks and laptops that actually have enough memory!! Nexient do outsourcing but with US-based staff, we work closely with clients so we're just part of the team.

Nexient are also working hard to add hundreds of tech jobs in Michigan and Ohio. There's a real need for good folks to help us help our clients.

----- Recruiting Dept's Description -----

Nexient is hiring! In 2009, we launched Nexient to give American businesses a more responsive, domestic alternative to sending software development offshore. We knew we could deliver better software faster by collaborating with clients in real time. Today, we’re the only 100% US tech company among the World’s Top 100 Outsourcers. Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.
We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks. The list of current openings is available at https://www.nexient.com/careers. These are full time positions working from Nexient’s delivery center at Ann Arbor, MI. Visa sponsorship and telecommute / remote work options are not available for these roles.

WinIt | Software Engineer | Flatiron, NYC | ONSITE | Full-time | Visa Available | $75k-$115k & Equity | Healthcare & Benefits | https://angel.co/winit-app/jobs/68416-software-engineer
About Us: WinIt is the industry leader helping drivers fight their parking & traffic tickets. Our long term goal is to become a one-stop solution to assist drivers with their automotive related challenges. This includes helping drivers finding the best price on auto insurance, leasing & financing options, mechanics etc. We've bootstrapped the company and have dismissed over $10 million worth of fines.
Our team: We are a small development team with members who take on multiple roles across the stack. We strive to always be improving our process and code bases, to use the correct tools for the tasks at hand, and to help grow our collective skills.

Your Role: We’re looking for a full-stack engineer driven to solve challenging problems with a clean and maintainable approach. You will write modular, high-quality code while actively contributing to peer code reviews. You are an intelligent, passionate, and innovative developer that can formulate new ideas and execute them within an existing development environment. Ideally, you enjoy a hands on approach in determining how you and the team can develop technology to meet the company’s business needs.

Skills: We’re seeking developers with full stack skills and experience. Our primary web application is written in Angular, however, we consider ourselves to be a React team.

Experience: Ideally you have previous startup experience, writing production level code, or experience deploying your own projects to a userbase.

Walmart Labs (https://www.walmartlabs.com) | Carlsbad, CA | FrontEnd Tools Engineer | Full Time | Onsite
I've been a developer for quite some time, and professionally for over 12 years. Like many of you, I've been frustrated with the software development process and the manual toil we have around that process - we want to solve problems in software, not in the way we write, test and deploy it!
That's why I'm excited by what my team at Walmart Labs does - the Developer Experience Tools team exists to create an amazing experience for the developer both within the Walmart Organization and outside with our Open Source contributions (see: http://testarmada.io/).

We're hiring right now, for a Staff level engineer to work on a set of automated tools to make measuring Client Performance of web and native mobile applications a breeze for developers.

We use javascript, nodejs, reactjs, redux and graphql heavily, but we're very much of the opinion that you should use the right tool for the job so there are no unnecessary limitations.

Our Carlsbad office is AWESOME, and the location - reasonably close to San Diego, right next to the ocean - is pretty fantastic. The office is a new location, a big upgrade on the previous location, freshly opened in October with onsite gym, and a short walk to the beach.

If you’d like to find out more or just chat about the role, message me here - or you can apply here: https://walmart.rolepoint.com/?shorturl=LawD5#job/ahBzfnJvbGVwb2ludC1wcm9kchALEgNKb2IYgIDQjeyotgkM

Would be amazing to speak to folks who want to find cool ways to take all the hassle out of developing software. I don't care if you have a degree or not.

You'd be joining a great team with some excellent fellow engineers. No recruiters please, No agencies. Please reach out if you are interested in the role for yourself!
dstevens@walmartlabs.com if email is how you prefer to ask questions.

WalmartLabs | Software Engineering (Clojure) | SF or REMOTE | FULL TIME
We're a small close-knit team backed by big company resources. We write mission-critical, robust software that's used by millions of Walmart's customers daily.

Our suite of software includes but is certainly not limited to:

- a large distributed system that processes all store transactions from every Walmart and Sam's Club store in the US. If you've ever used Walmart Pay, this is how you get your receipt!

- a massive GraphQL service that powers all customer purchase & returns history for all platforms (written using our own open-source GraphQL implementation for Clojure: https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia). We roll out new marquee customer-facing features in this service almost weekly: everything from tire installation services to bakery orders to propane tanks.

- services to allow customers to manage and purchase care plans

- push notifications

Our tech stack is: Clojure (for everything!), GraphQL, Cassandra, Kafka, Redis, Prometheus, Ruby (for some infrastructure tasks)

Here's a few things we value that you should have:

- A self-starter, curious, and DIY attitude. A lot of our bedrock technology is home-grown and written to solve our own unique Walmart-scale problems. One of the engineers on our team wrote an entire Clojure dialect (https://github.com/candid82/joker/), and scripts written in that language now do a lot of heavy lifting of our own infrastructure.

- A good intuition for writing code that won't fall over under pressure and handles failure states well. We deploy daily and a null pointer might impact millions of requests in a few minutes.

- An interest in doing DevOps-y stuff and a high expectation in good monitoring. We have full ownership of the life-cycle of our code and the servers it runs on.

- The ability to think and work in functional languages (Clojure)

- Experience writing distributed systems with a lot of message passing
If this sounds interesting to you, please reach out to bcarrell@walmart.com and say hello.

iBUILD | Mobile full-stack engineer | Full-Time | Austin, TX | ONSITE
iBUILD (https://ibuild.global) stimulates housing construction capacity to meet the pent-up global demand for affordable housing. An accessible, formal housing supply is simply non-existent for the majority of the world, leaving over 330 million households without adequate shelter. The iBUILD platform offers an elegant FinTech solution that empowers an untapped workforce to transact in a secure, transparent environment, with customers, lenders, architects and suppliers linked together in a powerful hybrid value chain. iBUILD formalizes and demystifies the construction process so that large scale developers and financial institutions, as well as the informal masses, are all able to track and manage their resources through an end-to-end solution for housing construction, transforming an unorganized marketplace into a vibrant transparent ecosystem.

We are a funded, rapidly-growing FinTech startup. Our engineering team is in Silicon Valley, CA; Austin, TX; and Nairobi, Kenya.

We are looking for a key early hire: a full-stack mobile engineer to work on our mobile and web clients. While the focus of this role is front-end (mobile and web) we are looking for someone who enjoys taking a systems perspective. You enjoy thinking not just about the component you are primarily responsible for but about the entire system. You would expect to have the entire system running on your laptop, and to be sufficiently proficient in backend technologies and databases to understand how the whole system fits together. You understand that optimizing individual components in isolation is not a good use of your time. We are not beholden to specific technologies: we are interested in people with experience in web technologies, HTML5-based mobile apps, Cordova/Ionic apps, iOS, and Android apps.

We currently handle over 100 billion events per day and need someone who can help us handle billions more. We're still pretty small on the engineering team, and everyone gets their hands dirty and makes a real impact.

A bunch of us play ultimate frisbee or soccer on Fridays, and we have regular dev seminars and lunch-and-learns to talk tech and learn from each other.

Required Technical Skills:

* 4+ Years of professional experience in Java.

* Experience building and owning, high volume, high availability distributed systems

* Knowledge of building and consuming RESTful services

* Experience with SQL and relational database design

* Write high-quality code using modern best practices

One or more of the following is considered a huge plus:

* Previous adtech or martech industry experience

* You’ve worked with: Kafka, Cassandra, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, or similar technologies

* Experience developing ETL pipelines.

commercetools | Software Engineer - Scala | On-Site | Full-Time | Berlin, Germany | https://commercetools.com/careers
We combine solving hard tech challenges you’d expect in a Silicon Valley startup with German work/life balance.

Our Backend-as-a-Service powers commerce in a wide range of industries, including automotive, robotics, gaming, on-demand printing, fashion and toys. We don’t run mom-and-pop stores - we excel for enterprise customers that need a commerce platform that is both customizable and yet highly scalable and reliable.

Some of the challenges you can help us with:

* Scaling a multi-tenant BaaS with heterogeneous traffic patterns. We continuously improve the performance of our code (written in Scala) as well as our persistence layer (MongoDB and ElasticSearch).

* Rework our data models where they aren’t suitable for our biggest enterprise customers. E.g. we need to support retailers with inventory across hundreds of stores.

* Multi-cloud, multi-region deployment: We offer our customers a choice between different cloud providers (including AWS and GCP) and regions.

* Adopt new technologies in our developer-facing products. E.g. we invest in GraphQL and CloudEvents, and participate in specification processes as well as Open Source projects.

We’re 150 people from 35 countries. We offer flexible work hours, home office and are parent friendly. I myself leave the office at 3:30pm three times a week to spend the afternoon with my son, and then spent another 2 hours working at home in the evening.
For the Scala job in our team see: https://commercetools-jobs.personio.de/job/41580?language=en# 
Feel free to message me if you have any questions at christoph DOT neijenhuis AT companyname DOT com (No recruiters, no agencies please.)

unnamed project | los angeles | software | part-time | onsite
This is mostly a stealth project and I'm trying to form a team. I'm the one that did the original search for this thing in about 2015 and have done a lot of startups for about 20 years. There's a couple exits in there.

This is the ground floor and I don't waste my time with vague nonsense ideas. There's existing code, a business plan and it's about to close a couple million dollar round.

There's half a dozen people involved and it has something to do with games and fintech. I know this is very vague, but if you can trust me, contact me at my username @ gmail.com. It should be fun.
I promise nothing more than adventure.

Waldo Photos | Senior Software Engineers  | Full-Time | Austin, TX  or REMOTE (Globally)
Waldo Photos (https://waldophotos.com/) is a photo finding platform utilizing facial and object recognition to empower consumers to toss their selfie sticks, put their phones back in their pockets and live in the moment. Waldo is the only platform that removes all of the friction in getting photos of you taken by others and creates new opportunities for photographers to market and sell their photos. Users can enjoy life’s most precious events and automatically receive images taken of them right on their phones or share images of others they’ve taken without having to lift a finger – whether between friends and family or a professional photographer.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself. And while camps and schools have been the first areas that Waldo has gained traction, the challenge of matching and delivery of the photos you care about is luckily not limited to just summer camps and schools which is further driving our product and market growth.

To meet this demand we are hiring immediately(and through the year) for:

* Senior Backend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/BE760CF400

* Senior Frontend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/7038D86015

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact
   * Market Competitive Salary
   * Stock options
   * Unlimited vacation policy
   * Fully remote work environment with a flexible work schedule
   * Startup growth and energy

If this interests you or you have questions, please reach out to me via email using the address in my profile and I will be happy to answer anything or you can apply directly via the links above.

<still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see each position).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer & more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4-5months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a lead/managerial role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)
More keywords for the CTRL+F'ers ;) : F#, C#, Xamarin, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, blockchain, smart contracts, stable coins, MakerDAO/DAI, etc.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and getting traction through pilot projects.

DataGrail | Senior / Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | $120k - $180k + 0.25% - %1 | ONSITE DataGrail provides privacy as a service.
Our users are Chief Privacy Officers, Data Protection Officers, or General Counsel inside our customers.  We build software to enable our customers to fulfill data access, data deletions, and opt outs as required by the EU Privacy Law (GDPR) and the new California privacy bill (CCPA).  Plus all the other upcoming state bills.

Data privacy and data protection should be a no-brainer. But the reality is many departments within organizations are not well-equipped to comply, so we're trying to help make that a more seamless process. In doing so, we think this will help give users more control over their personal data.

We have paying customers and have recently raised $4.2m.

* ruby/rails, go, some react

Uber ATG (Advanced Technologies Group) - Self-Driving, Autonomous Vehicles | Software Engineers, Engineering Managers | ONSITE Pittsburgh, PA | Full Time
Uber ATG is hiring for a large number of roles at both the Pittsburgh, PA and San Francisco, CA offices.

Pittsburgh openings: https://www.uber.com/careers/list/?city=pittsburgh&country=united-states-of-america&keywords=&subteam=software-engineering&team=advanced-technologies-group

San Francisco openings: https://www.uber.com/careers/list/?city=san-francisco&country=united-states-of-america&keywords=&subteam=software-engineering&team=advanced-technologies-group

In this post I’ll highlight a specific role on my team in Pittsburgh - a Robotics Infrastructure Software Engineer. This is the equivalent of a “full stack” position for robotics, ranging from low-level C++ performance optimization to sensor integration, to building better tools to streamline track testing. We don't do any firmware development on my team, but we interact closely with the team that does (so familiarity is useful).

As a robotics infrastructure software engineering, you will build and integrate core software systems running on-board our fleet of self-driving vehicles. Our team not only builds the APIs for sensor data, but is the first line of defense to dig into thorny, emergent performance and reliability issues on-board. Your software systems are where autonomy algorithms, after vetting in simulation, hit the road and have to deal with unreliable sensors, freezing temperatures, and the realities of operating a test fleet.

Technology we use on a daily basis:

* C++, Python, Go

* Clang sanitizers, valgrind, gperftools, googletest

* TCP, UDP, CAN, RTP, gRPC, TFTP, HTTP

* Yocto Linux, cgroups, Docker

* In-house autonomy infrastructure systems (similar in concept to ROS but tuned for our use cases)

* iptables, strongswan, ZebOS, BIND, nginx

* HIVE, SQL, Kibana, Grafana, statsd equivalent

* Qt, JavaScript (yes!)
Apply to this specific posting (“Backend Engineer, Self-Driving”) here: https://www.uber.com/careers/list/34543/ and also contact me directly (cpeplin@uber.com) so I can guide your application through the process to my team.

Chargefox | Melbourne, AU | Mid to senior software engineer | ONSITE | https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1196426058
Full time opportunity for a full-stack developer with expertise in React Native.

ABOUT CHARGEFOX

Chargefox is committed to sustainable mobility. We're Australia's largest open, electric vehicle (EV) network for modern EV's. As part of that, Chargefox raised $17 million to build a network of ultra-rapid chargers to connect major cities across the country, but that's only a fraction of what we do. We have an unwavering focus on simplifying the EV charging experience for everyone - be they drivers, fleet managers, charge station owners, car manufacturers, energy retailers or more.

Our customers can find, use and pay for electric vehicle charging using their mobile. We’re continually adding new stations to the Chargefox network. So far we've processed over 20,000 charging sessions on more than 500 plugs across Australia and New Zealand, dispensing a total of over 165MWh of electricity. That's enough electricity to power the average household for two decades, and we're still growing fast. We're excited!

Our apps are built in React Native, and we're looking for someone to join the team to help. Values really matter (really!), so we’re looking for someone who’s a great fit for these - (Customer Focus, Sustainability, Safety, Transparency, Integrity and Collaboration).

WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR
We're looking for someone with a deep expertise in React Native (experts in React or Android/iOS will be considered as well) who will be able to provide both technical leadership for the team and to also deliver features. At the same time you will be working and contributing on a variety of tasks including development and support of Ruby APIs, web applications and AWS infrastructure.
Remember our value on Customer Focus above? We want to see empathy for the driver and their experience along the way too.
We expect you to know how to build scalable and well architected software solutions. We're looking for engineers, rather than coders. At Chargefox, we are big believers in a pragmatic and agile approach to software development. You will be participating in team rituals including stand-ups, retrospectives, occasional pair-programming and on-call support. We are based in Melbourne, so you will be working in our office in the CBD.
SO, WHY US?
A chance to join a growing and dynamic start-up enabling the uptake of electric vehicles in Australia. This is a unique opportunity to be an integral part of something that is of true value to society.
We are fully funded and offer a competitive salary package.
A collaborative and supportive environment that will stretch you, but give you a chance to learn from and teach others.
We'll supply you with a new company laptop (if you need one).
If you think that we sound like a great place to work and you fit the bill, then please get in touch and send through your details.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Solar United Neighbors | IT Generalist | Full-time | Washington, DC | ONSITE or REMOTE | https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org
Women, minorities, people with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

Solar United Neighbors is a national nonprofit that organizes local communities around the country to go solar, join together, and fight for their energy rights.

We’re growing fast -- really fast. We’re expanding into new states, building new partnerships, and offering new services. That kind of growth requires a great IT infrastructure to help our members and supporters organize and advocate for solar at the state and national level. Your job is to help build the infrastructure that powers our growth.

IN THE FIRST YEAR, you can expect to work on projects that include:

- Work with our Go Solar team to CUSTOMIZE SALESFORCE to support new product lines and workflows, streamline their workload, and increase our ability to report on campaign performance.

- UPGRADE OUR COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (mass email, advocacy, event management, donations) to a more effective and flexible system (or systems) and integrate them with both our websites and with SalesForce.

- Work with our Growth team to REBUILD OUR WEBSITES to be more user-friendly, accessible, and effective at engaging our community of solar supporters.

- Work with our Engagement Director to DEVELOP WEB APPLICATIONS that automate the internal workflow for our two major national solar awareness campaigns -- Brews from the Sun and the National Solar Tour.

We’ve gone all-in with WordPress for our websites, so you need to know your way around WORDPRESS (and PHP in general) really well. Most of our core business logic lives in SALESFORCE, so you need to know how to customize SalesForce (custom objects, reports, workflows). Deploying and managing the servers will be your responsibility, so you need to be effective on the LINUX command line. And we have some data analysis projects on deck, so you need to be comfortable setting up DATABASES and writing SQL queries.

Just as important as all those technical skills -- maybe more! -- you need to be a COMMITTED TEAM PLAYER who is ready to shoulder responsibility, find the opportunity hidden in every problem, and build other people up.

Finally, you need to bring a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. We’re huge fans of applying the LEAN STARTUP model to our work -- building quick prototypes to test our ideas in the real world, collecting data to measure how well those ideas perform, and learning from that data so we can make the next version even better. If you bring data analysis skills, that’s a huge plus. Either way, an “ALWAYS BE TESTING” attitude is required.
You'll report directly to the VP OF GROWTH (me) and work with a committed and brilliant team of communications experts, policy wonks, digital marketers, and community organizers on projects with ambitious goals and aggressive deadlines.

Synthetic Minds (YC S18) | SF + Seattle | $120k+ | Engineer #5: commensurate equity | ONSITE, Full Time
The ideal candidate has a master/phd in systems, compilers, programming languages, or distributed systems. Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.

Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads/writes smart contracts in Ethereum's Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer's code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can even synthesize it.

In Oct 2018, we raised a $5.6M seed round from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [3]. We have paying customers and a backlog waiting to be on-boarded. This is the founder’s second startup and they have a PhD in the area. The 1st employee was the first hire at Parse (YC S11) and has 10 yrs at Google. We are currently hiring engineer #5, and aim to be a 15 person all-engineering team in 2019.

Roles/Openings [1]:

* Systems/infrastructure engineer — You’ll be working on distributing heavy CPU processes on AWS. Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node/process/memory/algorithm failures.

* Compilers/verification/synthesis engineer — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.

* Smart contract engineer — You'll be working on the front-end of the compiler, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis).

NoRedInk |Full-Stack Engineers,Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Narrative I/O | Scala Backend Engineer, Angular Frontend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | http://narrative.io/
Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.

- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.

- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.

- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.

We are hiring for a Scala Backend Engineering role and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

For frontend, Angular 6+ on the newer products, and a few mature products leveraging Javascript and JQuery. Many databases to store our 200TB+ of production data including MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, DynamoDB & RDS.

We have some monolithic applications though new products & platforms are built using microservices running Docker containers on AWS ECS with some footprint in Azure. We leverage many AWS services – Lambda, CloudWatch, S3, EC2, Route53, IAM, SQS, SNS and more. We also use Terraform for configuring infrastructure, Jenkins for CI, and Git/GitLab for source code. These are flexible (they can and will change) and what a candidate knows for stack is not as important as their ability to think creatively – we can train languages, it’s much harder to train curiosity and intellectual drive.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Engineering Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area.

US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

See edx.org, stanford.edu or fun-mooc.fr for examples of Open edX instances.

We are 27 senior developers, all working remotely from Europe, North & South America, Asia & Australia. The company is not affiliated with edX, but rather contributing and working with them on various projects. This is a full time position, where you would be able to work remotely from anywhere you want, as long as you have a good internet connection. : )

The Open edX platform is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. You would work on different clients contracts using the platform. The clients list/references include Harvard, MIT, edX themselves, the French government, and various startups & universities currently running their own instances, or looking to create one. Tasks are very varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working fullstack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.

Most of your work is published as free software (Open edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing most of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.

We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.

- Strong skills with one or more scripting languages (e.g., Python).

- Exposure to statistical languages (e.g., R) useful, but not essential.
