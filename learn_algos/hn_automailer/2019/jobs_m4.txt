We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end.

Microsoft | Boulder, CO | Senior Software Engineer | ONSITE (can frequently work from home) | Full Time
Microsoft is looking for a Senior Software Engineer in Boulder, CO for its Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team.

This is a role where you will work with a wide range of technologies and languages, developing cloud solutions side-by-side with software engineers outside of Microsoft. We are looking for a senior engineer who has a strong background in cloud architecture, a history of mentoring junior engineers, and strong software engineering skills. The role does involve traveling to customer locations roughly twice every three months (flying in on a Monday and out on a Friday) - all travel is planned well in advance.

This isn't a consulting role - there are no billable hours, we work side-by-side with external engineers building projects with them, not for them. Project schedules are determined collectively by both parties and we ensure we don't burn engineers out (work-life balance is a high priority). This role doesn't involve any on-call responsibilities during or after a customer project.

FlowCommand (YC W16) | Full-Stack Engineer, Data Engineer, Sensor Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | $120k - $150k + 0.5% - 1.0% | https://angel.co/flowcommand
FlowCommand builds a new type of sensor and software system to monitor fluid infrastructure around the world for leaks, theft, spills, and performance. Fleets of our proprietary lightweight hardware generate raw acoustic data and then send that data directly to our server via cellular/satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed) in pipes.

A few upcoming projects:

We’re planning to send a robotic submarine 10,000 ft underwater to attach our sensors to pipelines sitting on the ocean floor, with the goal of detecting and stopping oil leaks that harm marine wildlife. Build the application that allows operators to monitor their pipeline for leaks and alert them to an impending environmental disaster.

Our Houston office has a remotely operable flow loop (ie an obstacle course for fluids) that allows us to approximate field conditions and gather raw acoustic data. The digital signal processing specialists who write our firmware need to capture test data, but the sensor processes millions of measurements per second, making it difficult to store and process the test data. Build a system that allows them to efficiently test their latest DSP algorithms under a variety of flow conditions.
Technologies we currently use
Web Apps: Python, Django, React 
Data Pipeline: pandas, scikit-learn, Heroku/AWS
Sensor Firmware: C++, System VerilogPlease reach out at jobs@flowcommand.com

Skills: We’re seeking developers with full stack skills and experience. Our primary web application is written in Angular, however, we consider ourselves to be a React team. We’re developing new projects in React, and are actively transitioning our web app to React as well. We use Node.js on the backend, with MongoDB as the datastore for our primary products. We appreciate developers with an array of backend skills, but experience using Node in a backend environment is a must. Mobile experience is a plus, but we are not hiring strictly mobile devs at this time. Our applications are native Android and iOS applications, written in Java and Swift/ObjC respectively.
Experience: Ideally you have previous startup experience, writing production level code, or experience deploying your own projects to a userbase.

Scribd is a reading subscription that gives you access to the best books, audiobooks, magazines, and more. Our mission is to change how the world reads.

In Amsterdam we are hiring backend software engineers with solid experience in building, running and scaling out cloud-native microservices (preferably in Ruby and/or Go). We value a hacker mindset, clean coding and a natural aversion to complexity (or if you're a glass-half-empty person: an affinity for simplicity).

We are currently looking for a Recommendations Engineering Manager – someone who is experienced in leading, coaching and mentoring our recommendations engineering team. You have a strong technical background and are able to contribute to planning and technical design, and believe in building teams and practices that scale. You can motivate and instill a strong sense of ownership and pride in your team.

Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture with competitive salary and great benefits. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance. In general we care way more about your personality and hacking skills than what languages you’ve used so far.
We have hired many people from these threads, including myself. If you have questions you can reach out to me directly at adrian at scribd.com (I'm the Head of Technology and happy to answer questions related to these roles

Curebase | Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE (US only)
Biomedical R&D is at an all-time high, but clinical trials are still expensive, slow, and traditional. The reason is the limited pool of research hospitals which R&D sponsors (like pharmaceutical companies) can use to run their trials. The overhead and training required to do research constrains the supply of these research hospitals, and leads to massive inefficiency.

Curebase takes a new approach. We empower every physician to be a researcher with streamlined software. This lets us run any trial in parallel, and enables sponsors to bring their inventions to market faster than ever.

Today, we use our growing physician network to power studies in many exciting areas of medicine, such as smoking cessation, STD testing, and nutrition. We have also participated in Y Combinator S18 and raised $2.5MM in seed funding.
I'm looking for self-motivated, generalist web engineers to join us early. If meaningful ownership of a healthcare product and helping to define an engineering culture sound interesting to you, please email me directly via matt (at) curebase.com, or read more and apply at https://angel.co/curebase/jobs/

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

Systems and Technology Research | Software Engineer | Boston area | Full time
We solve hard problems, usually (but not always) for the government. We’re not some stodgy defense contractor but rather small teams of engineers, mathematicians and software engineers that get things done and actually deliver product. Some examples of the types of projects we work on are counter-botnet botnets and programming language research to improve security.

We’re particularly looking to hire software engineers that are well-versed in modern cloud environments and steeped in database tech. We're probably a little bigger than most companies here (about 200) but have great benefits and a flexible work environment -- everyone has their own office and the freedom to work on what they want. Feel free to apply through the website or through a PM to me – if the former, please mention hn!

SEEKING FREELANCERS/EMPLOYEES - NYC preferred, but remote quite conceivable

- good Node, React, Rails, WordPress, and enterprise Azure e-commerce developers, as well as excellent technical project managers. We prefer people with a reasonable amount of experience under their belt, but there are always exceptions.

- a couple of excellent, principal-level, general-specialist software engineers who are comfortable leading tech teams, identifying and solving clients' real (as opposed to reported) problems, architecting solutions from scratch, refactoring existing codebases, putting out occasional fires, and moving fairly seamlessly from one project / language / framework to another.
We do web and app (and occasionally some blockchain) development for a panoply of clients ranging from Fortune 500 to brand-new startups -- right now the distribution is roughly 50-50 -- and we pay well.

health care teams and making sure we can put the right information about a patient in the right hands at the right time.
We just closed our $2.5m seed round led by Future Ventures and are still literally working out of my garage in Silicon Valley, so if you ever wanted to get in on the ground floor of a Valley startup working to help people understand their health, this is it!

This is my third startup and I've spent significant time at larger companies like Google and Facebook so while there's a good chance we will fail (hey it's a startup), you'll be treated fairly and respectfully and will have kind, smart, and accomplished coworkers. We also have family so understand how to work hard while being present parents and we value that. This is going to be more of a marathon than a sprint.

ReadCoor | Hardware Software Engineer and Pipeline Software Engineer | Cambridge, MA | ONSITE, REMOTE | https://www.readcoor.com
ReadCoor is a company developing a platform for DNA sequencing in 3D tissue.  We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, chemists, hardware and software engineers building this technology to assist in the next leap of biological research and discovery.

Why 3D Spatial Sequencing?

Current state of the art DNA sequencing will tell you what raw "source code" you have. Various RNA sequencing technologies and recent single cell techniques will give you "runtime configuration" information.  These techniques will tell you what molecules are present in a tissue, but they do not tell you where the molecules are located.

Our sequencing technology maps their location in exquisite detail. We can, for example tell you not just that a virus’s DNA was found in a sample, but also allow you to view the intact tissue and see which individual cells were infected. We apply this technology to all areas of biomedical research including infectious disease, neuroscience, and cancer biology.

Pipeline Software Engineer

Our backend pipeline engineering role is responsible for building and scaling out our ingestion and processing pipeline.

This pipeline uses a lot of python (numpy, scipy, skimage, pandas, dask, zarr to name a few libraries) to process individual tissue samples which range in size from 1-5 TB of images (and growing).

Hardware Software Engineer

Our Hardware Software Engineer is responsible for writing code that enables our automated sequencing platform.

To accomplish this we use python, C++, and JS to control a complex mutli-axis imaging platform with integrated high-precision fluidics.
If interested, please visit https://www.readcoor.com/job-openings to see the Pipeline and Hardware positions.

Vetspire | Full Stack Software Engineer | New York, NY (25% on-site with clients and 75% remote) | Full-Time | https://vetspire.com
Vetspire is an AI-driven medical records and practice management platform for veterinarians. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.

We're looking for a full stack engineer to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. To do this, you’ll be working at every stage of patient care from the exam room to back-end analytics. Some examples of what your weeks may look like: creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time, designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders, or building a secure messaging platform for client and doctor communications.

You'll be working directly with our clients (the veterinarians and staff) using Vetspire, and talking with them almost every day to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It's an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone's pets. As such, this is more than just an engineering role, as, although you can code and develop remotely, you'll be expected to go into the hospitals every now and then to talk with the users directly, understand their needs, design solutions with them, and iterate on the results.

Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix/Absinthe application written in Elixir, our front end is a React SPA using the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.
Email me if interested at sam@vetspire.com (include "HN" in the subject).

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA
FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta.  The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!

DocStation | Senior Product Designer | Austin, Denver, REMOTE (US Only) | http://docstation.co
DocStation is a platform that makes it easy for pharmacists to transition away from dispensing pills to providing clinical care for patients. We built the platform with their workflow in mind as opposed to billing requirements, which plagues most of the industry/market. We’re also in a unique position because the majority of the tech innovation has happened at the Hospital/Health System level while pharmacy has been left in the stone age; which is a huge market opportunity as pharmacy starts to catch up.

We receive data from insurance claims on a daily, weekly, monthly cadence that we transform into patient profiles, medication lists, and insights in the UI in order to augment the clinical work of pharmacists to give them time back in their day. We have lots of data at our fingertips and we need your help presenting it to pharmacists so they can take even better care of their patients.
Apply here: https://docstation.workable.com/j/C2C67B6E2A?viewed=true

What we do actually matters.
It's estimated that 250,000 people die in America annually because of medical errors. That makes it the #3 cause of death, just behind heart disease and cancer ( https://goo.gl/zntNUd ). This is a major societal catastrophe - and it needs to be fixed. Part of the solution is the long-overdue modernization of our nation's health IT infrastructure. This is CareEvolution's mission - to create better patient outcomes by modernizing - and connecting - our health IT systems.

We're a small team - still under 100 people (and all technical!) - but our platform manages health data for over 130 million people.

We're looking for AWS engineers with experience in some of the following: EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, ELB, EBS. A more complete picture of job qualifications can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/249670/aws-devops-engineer-for-healthcare-software-careevolution

Gruntwork | Senior Full-Stack Engineer | 100% Remote | Full-Time | https://gruntwork.io
Our mission is to make it 10x easier to understand, build, and deploy software.

We are currently focused on knocking all the grunt work of DevOps, where our goal is to make it 10x easier to get up and running with production-grade infrastructure as code on major cloud providers like AWS and GCP.

You'll work with a wide range of tech including Go, Python, Bash, AWS, GCP, Terraform, Docker, Node, React, and whatever else is necessary to solve the problem. Prior experience is less important than an ability to quickly ramp up. Much of your work will be open source.

We are 100% self-funded and have been profitable from day 1. We compute salaries and bonuses formulaically, which results in an above-market salary with generous benefits. We also employ a progressive equity system to more equitably distribute the proceeds of any future liquidity event.

Commure, Inc. | San Francisco, CA / Boston, MA | Rust Engineer | Fulltime | ONSITE
We are a stealth startup working to fix the software doctors use. If you have seen what physicians have to put up with, it's a bad version of the 90s, and makes medical care worse and more expensive for everyone. We are a group of previously successful engineers and entrepreneurs (MIT, Dartmouth, Stripe, Twitter, Salesforce, DataPower, etc) and senior doctors (Johns Hopkins, UCSF, etc) who are determined to finally fix this.

Compensation: market salary & equity -- we are well funded by top-tier VCs.

Stack: includes Rust, React and Kubernetes. In addition to building our back end in Rust, we are also solving some very interesting problems in the areas of data transformation, high-speed APIs, flexible UX frameworks and fine-grained authorization for healthcare data.

Please email jobs@commure.com and mention "[hnrust]" in the subject line.

Other positions available: - Senior Front End Engineer (React Native, React) - Senior Security Engineer (SAML, identity, OAuth, etc) (please use [hnfe] or [hnse] in subject line for the above).
Locations: San Francisco, Boston or Montreal; sorry, no distributed/remote option at the moment.

Aerian | Bath, UK | JavaScript / TypeScript / React / React Native | ONSITE | aerian.com
We're a 25-person agency based in the woods just outside Bath, creating web and mobile apps and games for large and small clients. These include the BBC (hundreds of projects), CNN, Historic Royal Palaces (the Tower of London!), as well as lots of non-profits and public sector clients.

We're hiring mid-level and senior JS devs, ideally with experience with React or similar frameworks. A lot of the work will be TypeScript, but it's OK if you don't have experience using it yet. You'd be working on a mix of greenfield projects and maintaining existing projects, and while it would mostly be front-end it would probably include some Node work too - including voice skills.

Our hiring process has a short at-home project, and an in-person interview possibly with a phone-screen beforehand if you're not nearby. The interview doesn't have whiteboard coding or quizzes, but is based around discussion of your at-home project.

Perks include free gym, electric car scheme and working on lots of interesting projects.
If you're interested, get in touch with me directly: matt.kane@aerian.com

Tezos (Nomadic Labs) | Technical/Documentation Writer | Paris, FR | ONSITE
Tezos is a top-20 cryptocurrency project with a focus on on-chain governance and security. We're a decentralized ecosystem with multiple entities working together toward a common goal.

Among other hiring needs (in NYC, Paris, Europe-generally, etc.), we're particularly interested in (English-language) technical writer/documentation and training developers to help build some really good developer, integrator, and end user documentation.

We're also constantly hiring (mainly PhD) OCaml developers and other technical roles, but we've got a more solid pipeline of those people -- tech writer, training development, and release engineering less so so far.

Compensation/etc. is "market". Perk: you get to work with a ~35 person team with ~22 CS PhDs, great ties to French academic institutions, etc., and a beautiful office in Paris (with private offices, with doors). Open source software, lots of opportunity to learn/grow your career and network.

Speaking French is helpful (socially, since you're in Paris), but you can get by professionally in English-only if you'd like (but you probably want to learn French, at least for the great restaurants).

We'd like this to be ONSITE in Paris, but there is travel to NYC/Zurich/etc. as you wish. Happy to help with relo, visa, etc. as needed (EU person is probably easier, but for the right people we'd hire globally for someone who wants to be in Paris).
For more information please contact me at ryan.lackey@tezos.com and I'll put you in touch with the hiring manager, or answer preliminary questions.

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

Metomic (https://metomic.io) | London | ONSITE | Backend Engineer and Fullstack
Our mission is to build a new standard for data privacy and data ethics.

We believe strongly in the power of sharing data, but we realise that consumers need controls and transparency before they can trust companies with it. And we believe that the way to get this right is to make it as _easy as possible_ for companies to do the right thing.

So that's what we're building. Technology that watches technology, helps make sense of the all-too-common mess of sprawling internal data flow, and a consumer facing plug-n-play user-experience to close the loop.

We're an early seed-stage startup with competitive salaries and equity to boot. As an early member, you'll be helping us define the future of this space. If you like autonomy, ownership and have opinions ... come say hi!

We're a new startup from Boston (< 6 months old) focused on the $20 Trillion dollar global seaborne trade market.

FreightFlows provides aggregated, predictive analytics for global trade. While maritime data continues to grow in volume and complexity, actionable insights continue to be elusive. The industry instead deals with inaccurate, stale and biased data from many fragmented sources. The complexity of bringing together trusted, timely information means companies have had to rely on dubious, incomplete market insight and therefore make decisions on anecdotal evidence.  FreightFlows uses proprietary data science algorithms to synthesize data into trade truth, predictive analytics and actionable intelligence for traders, shippers, owners and brokers.

Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:
- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

<Confidential - Energy Sector> | Software / ML Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time
We are a small, profitable, bootstrapped company that applies machine learning (ML) to fluid dynamics (FD) systems.

We are looking for an engineer to work closely with the founder and form the core of our team.

Role

* The FD models are developed by a specialized ML team; they’re evaluated in a simulated environment, where a second ML layer decides agent action based on FD model output.

* Everything except development of the FD models is under the purview of this role.  (You’re absolutely welcome to dive into that; it’s just not a requirement.)

* Minimal bureaucracy: we're a tiny team with existing customers.  We don't have outside investors to persuade.  There's very little friction in going from idea to production.

Responsibilities

* Build data pipelines to request, transform and store data.  (This is a small component of the role.)

* Build (statistical / machine-learned) agent actions based on FD model outputs.

* Develop an event-driven simulation environment to evaluate FD and agent models.

* Work closely with FD team to iterate on FD model based on simulation performance.

* Deploy pipelines and trained FD and agent models into production.  Capture events and model inference.

Skills

* Extensive experience (ideally using Python) to build high-availability, complex systems.

* Intimate familiarity with the Python scientific data stack.

* Experience with "classical" machine learning, such as tree-based models and Bayesian methods.

* Nice-to-have: math or physics background.
We prefer remote candidates in the US or Canada, but would consider those in the UK and the EU.  Write us at confidential.energy@gmail.com.

Inventables | Chicago, IL | ONSITE
My team is hiring software engineers. We make and sell CNC carving machines for entrepreneurs and small businesses.

We write software for every step of the process, from purchasing the machine and materials to creating a design to driving the machine.
I've been working here as a software engineer for three years, and I'm really excited about our next phase of growth and the work we have planned for this year.

Our tools process millions of patient records to predict what kinds of medical risk and problems will befall a patient and other medically relevant parameters. Join us to learn about the many intricacies of medical data, how to handle very large volumes of patient records, and how to build pipelines to operationalize cutting-edge machine learning models.

TalkJS | REMOTE (Europe) or ONSITE (Eindhoven, Netherlands) | https://talkjs.com
TalkJS lets developers build custom chat features in hours instead of months. We're product driven and we power communication inside online marketplaces, community sites, trading platforms and so on.

⠀

-- HEAD OF SALES --

Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing to the point that we have more leads than we can manage. This means that now is the time to double down on sales, so we're looking to make our first dedicated sales hire.

We're looking for someone who:


    * Loves tech
    * Has demonstrable experience selling technology B2B
    * Wants to jump on a rocket ship that's just taking off²

We offer you an opportunity to start, build, and lead our sales team as we grow. Significant equity is on the table, as well as the chance to work in a great collaborative, open and constructive distributed team culture.
Read more & apply via https://talkjs.com/jobs/

²) I'm well aware that this is a platitude, but in our case it's really quite true and it wasn't half a year ago. We're blowing up and we need your help :-)

⠀

-- MOBILE DEVELOPER WHO LOVES API DESIGN --

TalkJS is currently focused on the web and that's just not good enough. Easy to use APIs and SDKs are the key to our success on the web, and we're looking to do this natively on mobile as well. We could use your help with that.

If you're an experienced developer who's good at coming up with Java and Swift APIs that Android/iOS devs love to use, then get in touch. We don't have the job opening published yet, so just email to hey@talkjs.com. Bonus points if you can show us an API you designed (on any platform).

Like the sales job, this is remote (Europe) or on-site in Eindhoven, NL.

⠀
No recruiters or agencies, please.

ANN ARBOR, MI and COLUMBUS, OH | ONSITE
To apply, please use either my email address, aclark@nexient.com OR https://www.nexient.com/careers

----- My take -----

(I'm a Sysadmin / DevOps person, I'm not HR or recruitment, but my posting here has been approved by the recruiting dept.)

Nexient are good people: My experience at Nexient has been overwhelmingly positive, they are flexible, caring and fun to work at. They actually care about the life/work balance too. Multiple tabletop, D&D, console gaming nights are organized all the time. Charity drives and other ways to give are also promoted within the company. The work environment is really nice too, with motorized standing/sitting desks and laptops that actually have enough memory!! Nexient do outsourcing but with US-based staff, we work closely with clients so we're just part of the team.

Nexient are also working hard to add hundreds of tech jobs in Michigan and Ohio. There's a real need for good folks to help us help our clients.

----- Recruiting Dept's Description -----

Nexient is hiring! In 2009, we launched Nexient to give American businesses a more responsive, domestic alternative to sending software development offshore. We knew we could deliver better software faster by collaborating with clients in real time. Today, we’re the only 100% US tech company among the World’s Top 100 Outsourcers. Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.
We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks. The list of current openings is available at https://www.nexient.com/careers. These are full time positions working from Nexient’s delivery center at Ann Arbor, MI. Visa sponsorship and telecommute / remote work options are not available for these roles.

Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineers; Product Managers; Data Scientists | San Francisco, CA | Onsite
Academia.edu is a distribution and peer review platform for academic research. The Academia.edu platform addresses two problems:

- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic paper ever written on the internet, available for free.

- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.

It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.

With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 20 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 60 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.

With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community.

Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company has a freemium business model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."
We are looking to hire full stack software engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

Crux Informatics | Infrastructure Engineer | San Francisco (SF) or New York (NYC) | ONSITE | https://jobs.lever.co/cruxinformatics
The Crux Infrastructure team’s mission is to provide infrastructure products that enable Engineering to work efficiently, run reliable services, and remain secure. We build products designed to be used by our fellow engineers. These products can be anything from amazing development environments, to seamless continuous delivery services, to simple out-of-the-box service monitoring, to core compute infrastructure that just works.

You might like this role if you:

- Enjoy writing Python and/or Go (golang), and can write high quality code

- Sweat the details, while focusing on impact

- Aim higher, while keeping it simple

- Hear about a proposed design and immediately start thinking about the end-to-end workflow, edge cases, failure modes, and security risks

- Are excited about building internal products that make your fellow engineers happier and more productive, and our services more reliable and secure

- Think observability is critical to running reliable services

- Love the idea of unleashing a simian army to wreak havoc on systems

- Get satisfaction from helping others

- Can geek-out about Linux to the point that those around you think you are weird

We don’t expect a single candidate to be an expert in all areas, but if some of these ring true to you, you might like this role.

The company:

With Crux, companies can harness data without the high costs. Our data engineers deliver action-ready data to businesses via our cloud platform. By delivering action-ready data through the cloud, we dramatically reduce the need for companies to build infrastructure to manage and process data. We also eliminate the burdensome tasks which eat up 80% of data teams’ time and energy—wrangling data to prepare it for analysis. We help people devote their time and energy at work to finding insights and creating returns—the work that’s truly valuable.

Raytheon CWMI | USA (multiple locations) | Full Time | On Site
I'm an engineer with Raytheon's Cyber Warfare Mission Innovations (CWMI) and wanted to reach out to the hackernews community and let you guys know what we're looking for. All comments here are mine and mine alone and not endorsed by Raytheon proper. Any questions leave them here (preferably so others can benefit) or PM me. I'll answer them if I can.
For more information feel free to message me at needsmoarcyber@gmail.com
or visit https://www.raytheon.com/cyber .
We're looking for people who want to break things and have fun doing it. We're looking for developers, hackers, researchers, and engineers with an interest in information security and low level development. We take our work and our fun seriously. We refuse any work that isn’t hard and engaging. We make sure our engineers have the tools they need to do their jobs, and focus on recognizing results.

Key areas of focus include:
• Reverse Enginering
• Vulnerability Research
• Wireless and Network Communications
• Hypervisors
• Malware
• Mobile/Embedded Development
• Win32/Linux Kernel development
• Constraint Solving
• Exploit mitigation techniques
Basically, if it’s in the cyber (yes we said it) realm, we’re doing something cool with it.

Familiarity with at least one common low-level architecture (x86, ARM, etc) is important, as is the ability to conduct vulnerability research against applications compiled for that architecture. Experience with software protection and binary armoring is a plus, and familiarity with modern exploit mitigation techniques and counter-measures is a must.

Aside from reverse engineers and researchers, we are also looking for developers with an interest in low level systems development. If you're comfortable living in the kernel, developing emulators, or similar kinds of work, we'd love to hear from you! C and C++ skills are definitely a plus.

US Citizenship & the ability to obtain a Top Secret clearance is required. If you're already cleared, even better!
Our headquarters is in Indialantic, FL with offices in Annapolis Junction, MD; Ballston, VA; Dulles, VA; San Antonio TX; Austin, TX; Augusta, GA; Huntsville, AL; and Greenville, SC. Relocation assistance is available.

We currently handle over 100 billion events per day and need someone who can help us handle billions more. We're still pretty small on the engineering team, and everyone gets their hands dirty and makes a real impact.

In addition to gaining deep experience with developing systems at scale, you'll work with a world-class data science team (winners of multiple KDD Best Paper and other awards) that keeps us on the cutting edge of machine learning research. You'll gain direct exposure to the ins and outs of the rapidly growing and evolving adtech industry.

We place a high value on maintaining a good work-life balance, avoiding grinds and focusing on getting things done rather than putting in long hours. A bunch of us play ultimate frisbee or soccer on Fridays, and we have regular dev seminars and lunch-and-learns to talk tech and learn from each other.

Required Technical Skills:

* 4+ Years of professional experience in Java.

* Experience building and owning, high volume, high availability distributed systems

* Knowledge of building and consuming RESTful services

* Experience with SQL and relational database design
* Write high-quality code using modern best practices
One or more of the following is considered a huge plus:
* Previous adtech or martech industry experience

* You’ve worked with: Kafka, Cassandra, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, or similar technologies

* Experience developing ETL pipelines.

* Experience with Javascript frameworks/HTML/CSS

* Knowledge of Machine Learning, Distributed Systems or Big Data.

* Exposure to CI / CD (with either Docker, Kubernetes, SaltStack or Jenkins)

Peakon is the world's leading platform for measuring and improving Employee Engagement. We started Peakon to help companies around the world build better workplaces. We are a data company - not just a survey company - and this allows us to provide insights that will transform businesses.

As part of our company goals for 2019, we are scaling our Engineering and Product team and are currently looking for multiple roles:

* Multiple Senior Backend Engineers (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/941871)

* QA Engineer (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/947182)

Our tech stack of Peakon centres around Javascript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain across the stack, enabling engineers to work on all parts of the system. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are big fans of new JavaScript language features like async/await, and have made it a priority to stay up to date with the latest versions of Node. We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with an increasing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.
Trust and transparency guide everything we do. At Peakon you’ll find a transparent salary model, unlimited vacation, minimal hierarchy, and maximum freedom to develop and execute your own ideas. Our style of collaboration is based on honesty and friendship, and we always love making new friends!

Trade Me | Senior Android Developer | Full-time | ONSITE | VISA | Wellington, New Zealand |
Trade Me is an online used and new goods marketplace. It's like the New Zealand version of eBay or Amazon. Our Android app is one of the most popular apps in NZ, updated fortnightly with hundreds of thousands of daily users.

The role is based in Wellington, the "coolest little capital in the world." See the promotional website: https://www.wellingtonnz.com/discover/

Wellington is a small city with a big heart. There is a strong coffee culture and some of NZ's most beautiful scenery is nearby.

All our new code is in Kotlin and we use MVI for our new features. We use Android architecture components and dagger-android.

There are lots of opportunities for growth in the company and interaction with more than ten other Android developers in a guild.

Autonomy is important for us so in our squad you will get a chance to have your say in the direction of the products we develop. There is also the leisure to refactor and work on open source if you so desire. Limited work from home may be a possibility in the future but you would have to be based in Wellington.
I'm active on Stack Overflow so please check out my questions and answers to see if you agree with some of my philosophy ;-) 
https://stackoverflow.com/users/5241933/david-rawson
Would love to hear from senior devs who are amicable, interested in software architecture and design patterns, like to mentor junior devs, and want to work to raise engineering standards.

commercetools | Software Engineer - Scala | On-Site | Full-Time | Berlin, Germany | https://commercetools.com/careers
We combine solving hard tech challenges you’d expect in a Silicon Valley startup with German work/life balance.

Our Backend-as-a-Service powers commerce in a wide range of industries, including automotive, robotics, gaming, on-demand printing, fashion and toys. We don’t run mom-and-pop stores - we excel for enterprise customers that need a commerce platform that is both customizable and yet highly scalable and reliable.

Some of the challenges you can help us with:

* Scaling a multi-tenant BaaS with heterogeneous traffic patterns. We continuously improve the performance of our code (written in Scala) as well as our persistence layer (MongoDB and ElasticSearch).

* Rework our data models where they aren’t suitable for our biggest enterprise customers. E.g. we need to support retailers with inventory across hundreds of stores.

* Multi-cloud, multi-region deployment: We offer our customers a choice between different cloud providers (including AWS and GCP) and regions.

* Adopt new technologies in our developer-facing products. E.g. we invest in GraphQL and CloudEvents, and participate in specification processes as well as Open Source projects.

We’re 150 people from 35 countries. We offer flexible work hours, home office and are parent friendly. I myself leave the office at 3:30pm three times a week to spend the afternoon with my son, and then spent another 2 hours working at home in the evening.
For the Scala job in our team see: https://commercetools-jobs.personio.de/job/41580?language=en... Feel free to message me if you have any questions at christoph DOT neijenhuis AT companyname DOT com (No recruiters, no agencies please.)

GE Aviation | Software & Data Engineers | Full-time | Cincinnati, Detroit, Cheltenham | ONSITE
GE Aviation's cybersecurity team is hiring for a large number of software and data engineering positions. If you've taken a flight recently, odds are good that it was powered by a GE Aviation aircraft engine - our business continues to show strong growth, and a key enabler of that growth is the security team that keeps our employees and data safe. We're a relatively small team in a big business, with a challenging mission to solve security problems at scale (and ample autonomy and resources to do so). Our team is product-oriented, with a focus on building tools that help our analysts respond to threats and help our users protect their data.

We're looking for developers who are independent, curious, and comfortable working on both established and greenfield products. If you're someone who likes to take ownership of ideas from whiteboard to production, you'll find there's tons of opportunity to do so here.

Prior experience in cybersecurity is not required, but some interest in it is encouraged. Don't be scared off by the job postings - if you're ambitious and enthusiastic, we want to talk to you.

Keywords: Python, Typescript, Node, React, Docker, MySQL, Kafka, Devops, AWS

Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/ Positions: Full-Stack Engineer, Data Scientists, R&D Product Formulator / Scientist Overview: Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception of flavor, aroma, and texture to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products, enter new markets, and optimize their existing brands. We're a diverse 12 person post Series-A startup.
Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, Java, GraphQL, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS
The Position(s)

_Data Science_: We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. Our Data Science team develops new models and algorithms from scratch to make second-order inference on sparse data sets from non-representative samples that generalizes to the underlying target population. We rely on cutting edge models such as persistent homology, PU Learning, and metric learning to make predictions on non-eucldian human sensory data. We don't use tensor flow or pandas or keras as they are not a good fit for our problem space. We prefer a deep understanding of math and stats VS experience running logistic regressions in Python. (but we're cool with Python / Logit / experience)

_Engineering_: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Data-Engineers with experiance in micro-batch processing for machine learning pipelines.
Next Steps: please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

Transcriptic (YC W15) | Scientific Software engineers, Backend Engineers | Menlo Park, CA | https://transcriptic.com | FULL TIME; ONSITE
Transcriptic is creating a fully automated, integrated, and programmatically controlled science lab to change how science is performed and turn science execution into an information technology. Scientists anywhere can define and (reproducibly!) run experiments over the internet on-demand and without investing up-front in a lab facility.

The Transcriptic Common Lab Environment (TCLE) takes Autoprotocol (http://autoprotocol.org/), a high-level JSON description of a science protocols, and executes it on our custom-integrated robotic facilities. The protocols we handle routinely involve solving constraint programming models with thousands of variables and constraints in order to find the best plan that fulfills the scientist’s intent. We are looking for backend engineers to help us with this effort.

Scientists manage their experiments through our web application or via our API. We provide a single platform that controls scientific devices from many vendors in a unified way, and an interface to control our automated labs. We are looking for full-stack engineers to help build out our web app.

Turning science into an information technology requires being able to encode, abstract, and execute scientific intent programmatically. We work to span the gap between science and our software stack to ensure that science is being correctly abstracted and faithfully executed as well as work on the leading edge to create tooling for better protocol development. We are looking for software engineers with scientific knowledge to join our scientific software engineering group to help define and build out how science will be encoded.

Tech stack includes: Linux, Python, Scala, RabbitMQ, Rails, Typescript, React, Ansible, Postgres
Benefits include: full medical/dental/vision insurance; catered lunch and dinner, and a fully stocked kitchen; flexible vacation policy; 401(k) with matching; gym and commuter reimbursement; and education reimbursement up to $3,000/year.

Threema GmbH | Pfäffikon SZ (near Zürich), Switzerland | https://threema.ch/en | ONSITE
- Senior Software Engineer Android (Java / Kotlin) 80-100%

- Web Developer (PHP / JS / MySQL) 80-100%

Threema is a mobile messenger focused on privacy, launched in 2012. The business model is paying our expenses by selling the app (around 3€ one-time) as well as business subscriptions (called Threema Work, same app but with MDM capabilities). There are no external investors, the company is fully self-funded (and will stay that way). We manage our own bare-metal servers (no cloud). Leading principles are always user privacy, end-to-end encryption and storing as little user data as technically possible. Around 5 million active users, mostly in Germany / Switzerland. Clients include Daimler, Bosch and the Swiss government (no, there's no backdoor). For technical details, see the crypto whitepaper: https://threema.ch/press-files/2_documentation/cryptography_whitepaper.pdf

We're a small team, almost all employees are developers (the 3 founders are also devs). Flat hierarchies, a lot of freedoms in how you work. Homeoffice day possible. The usual perks (private health insurance, standing desks, pinball machine, espresso machine). Good work/life balance (nice bike trails and paragliding spots close to the office). And of course, Switzerland is generally a great place to work!

(Some keywords for the Ctrl+F people:) Programming languages we use at the company: Java (Android) / C / Objective C / Swift / Rust / Python / PHP / TypeScript. The infrastructure runs on FreeBSD and Linux servers. Both apps (iOS / Android) are fully native (no cross-platform frameworks). We also do a few things with WebRTC (webclient and calls).

With the Android position, you'd be the person responsible for the Threema Android app. With the Web Dev position, you'd be mostly involved in developing the web based management platform for our business customers.

If you'd like to apply, you should have good German language skills. We could probably help with visa applications though, in case you'd need to relocate.
I think that's about it. If you'd like to know more, let me know at db@threema.ch (or via Threema 43C98BNT). I hope I'll be able to answer any questions :)

Hazel Analytics | Data Scientist | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $150K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics is a fast-growing food tech company on a mission to create innovative products that transform the way organizations use food safety data. Founded in 2014 by prominent professors whose careers include decades of research at Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Maryland, we are the proven market leader in health department data analytics, serving nearly half of the largest 100 food retail chains.

Our Food Safety Insights (FSI) platform transforms diffuse and disparate local health department data into actionable intelligence. As a result, our customers — including Amazon, Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, and Whole Foods — can rely on Hazel Analytics technology to proactively monitor food safety and regulatory compliance at over 100,000 locations that serve millions of meals every day in the US and Canada.

Hazel Analytics is a proud recipient of the 2019 Food Marketing Institute Food Safety Innovation Award and the 2016 Jack in the Box Food Safety Innovation Award. We've also had opportunities to be involved in interesting projects such as this recent collaboration with ESPN: http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25316231/health-inspection-reports-find-critical-violations-nfl-nhl-nba-mlb-stadiums-2018-espn-lines

We are profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution.

As a data scientist with Hazel Analytics, you will help identify new opportunities and develop high-impact data analytics, predictive models, and statistical tools that will generate practical and actionable inputs for our user community. You will be expected to be both a creative and critical thinker, have strong judgment in prioritization and execution, and strike a balance between moving quickly and delivering high-trust analytics. Our ideal candidate not only thinks and acts like a leader but also rolls up their sleeves to explore and implement new analytical models.

Lightning Labs | Frontend Developer, Crypto Protocol Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite or Remote | Full-timehttps://angel.co/lightning/
https://lightning.engineering/
Lightning Labs is hiring! We’re looking to expand our team to build technology that scales Bitcoin and blockchains. Our current focus is the development and deployment of the Lightning Network, an open blockchain scalability protocol. We push the edge of innovation with regard to blockchain scalability, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX. If you’re interested in one of the positions below, please send a brief description of your relevant experience and resume/github to jobs@lightning.engineering. And if you know someone who might be a good fit, we'd very much appreciate any referrals.

{Crypto Protocol Engineer}:

Experienced systems software engineer versed in applied cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems, open source software, and cryptocurrency protocols to design and implement core protocol and algorithmic components of the Lightning Network. Solid programming skills, experience with Go, C, or C++. Prior contributions to crypto protocols and open source software collaboration preferred.

{Frontend Application Developer}:

Frontend developer to build secure cross-platform second-layer blockchain applications. Our applications are built on React, React Native, MobX, and Electron, communicating with a Lightning daemon over a binary RPC protocol. Ideal applicants will have experience building and shipping React Native applications and maintaining open source projects.

{Infrastructure and Distributed Systems Engineer}:

Systems-oriented engineer to build highly-available, secure systems, lowering the barrier to entry for operating routing nodes and making Lightning more useable in general. Tasks include writing advanced software tooling for automated channel management, initial client channel selection (autopilot), ongoing capital management and optimization, monitoring infrastructure for routing nodes, and creating novel systems for obtaining and managing channel liquidity within the network.

{DevOps Engineer}:
We currently deploy a number of backend services that make Lightning easier to use built on technology such as: etcd, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, and Traefik. Your role would be to help us secure and scale these systems via intelligent automation and robust service architecture. Experience with AWS is a bonus, as well as experience with Bitcoin, particularly in the area of key management.

Mux | All sorts of roles across the organization | SF, London | Full-time | https://mux.com/jobs
Just going to drop in the blurb on our jobs page, but the tl;dr is we build cool video infrastructure. Our stack is mostly Elixir, TypeScript (React/Redux), Go.

The first product we launched was analytics and performance monitoring - think “NewRelic for Video” - used by major video streaming companies like PBS, Vimeo, CBS Interactive, and the New York Times to monitor and improve billions of streams.

In early 2018, we launched Mux Video, a simple API to video hosting, encoding and streaming - think "Stripe for Video" - which uses our performance data, machine learning, and just-in-time encoding for unmatched video quality and efficiency. POST a video in; GET a video out that plays anywhere and is deeply optimized for the target device and user. We think building with video should be fun, not complicated.

You’ll be joining an amazing team from places like Google/YouTube, Twitch and Brightcove. Our founders previously started (and sold) Zencoder, an early leader in cloud video technology. We also authored Video.js, the biggest HTML5 video player on the web.
If you want to chat more about any of these roles or the company before applying, feel free to drop me a line: matt at mux.com

Fast-growing FinTech startup | Full Stack Developer | Onsite | €50.000 ~ €62.000 | Berlin, Germany | VISA
TL;DR: If you want to write F# and TypeScript while working with cool people on a fast growing business, shoot me an e-mail!

We are a fast-growing FinTech startup with a team built out of seasoned people, both on the operational side and on the technical side. We are looking for a smart and motivated addition to our team in Berlin. The role is full-stack but we don't see a specific preference for either front- or backend as a downside.

You will work within an agile process, in a fast-moving but structured environment. You will have a high degree of autonomy and be expected to provide working solutions, taking responsibility from the conceptual phase up to after the delivery. You will have architectural and technical freedom, and we believe in using the best tool for the job (TypeScript & F# are examples).

We work with pull requests, do code review for every feature, we have a dedicated QA team and we try to automate things as much as possible. We do continuous integration, and believe in keeping a high-quality codebase. We love tests and TDD. In general, we strive to work according to best practices.

Here's what you bring to the table:

– Fluency in JavaScript both in frontend and backend.

– Experience with Node.js, and frontend frameworks such as React or equivalent.

– Experience with TypeScript or similarly typed languages. All new web code is written in TypeScript and old code is being progressively converted. We use F# in production and the financial services are written in it, and run on AWS.

– Strong awareness of the interplay between JavaScript and HTML & CSS, and familiarity with Single-Page Applications. Ideally, you have developed internal systems or Web Applications for complex business domains before.

– Strong communication skills with the ability to lead team meetings and find creative solutions to complex problems. You enjoy driving continuous improvement and innovation.

– Eagerness to learn new things. We don't believe in chasing fads, but we're not scared of learning new techniques when they're needed.

––––––––

Here's what we bring to the table:

– Competitive remuneration package, rewarded for the success of the business (equity).

– Learning and career development with weekly team teach-ins, as well as “extra-curricular” development: We make available a budget of 2% of your yearly wages which you can use at your disposal on training/workshops/learning, as long as it's business-related :-)

– Beautiful office in the heart of Berlin (Hackescher Markt).

– Choose your own equipment.

– Standard Berlin perks of social events, meet ups and, of course, snacks and free cold beer in the fridge.

Personal note: I've been working here for almost one year and I feel fulfilled and happy. This opening is to work with me on my team and I wouldn't post this on HN if I didn't feel it was a great opportunity.

If this all sounds interesting, send me an e-mail at adelgado1313@gmail.com, ideally with your CV and whatever else you'd like to show us, and let's set up a quick call or a coffee – whatever you prefer :-)
We will sponsor work visas for candidates who need sponsorship in order to be eligible to work in Europe.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer &amp; more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.

Fulcrum Website: http://www.fulcrumpro.com
Small businesses have come to expect intuitive, fast, and beautiful software in their personal lives yet deal with old, slow, and clunky software in their business lives. We are changing that.

We've built a three stage rocket to get us to where we want to go:

First Stage (COMPLETE): consulting to gain deep experiences in a complicated domain filled with old legacy incumbants.

Second Stage (IN FLIGHT): scalable configurable enterprise product for manufacturers and construction companies utilizing new technologies and frameworks for hard problems like scheduling and forecasting.

We need talented full stack developers who have empathy for users and love making thoughtful and simple solutions to complex problems; developers who want to see their software used daily. About 70% of our work is currently focused on building software for short run manufacturing companies. We're looking for developers to help us transition and build our experiences and codebase into an increasingly scalable product platform.

We value hard work and perseverance. We have never once given up on a single customer and have worked tirelessly through endless challenges to ensure that we are delivering value and that each and every company we touch is better after using our software.

We value proactive work, open-mindedness, self-sufficiency, and subscribe to the idea that knowledge and continuous learning is valuable even it is not directly applicable. Our favorite tools include C#, TypeScript, NodeJS, Angular, and Kendo.

r2c | Infrastructure, Full Stack, Program Analysis Engineers | San Francisco | Onsite, Full-time | https://ret2.co
We're a small San Francisco startup passionate about analyzing code and measuring its security. We provide tools to developers, hackers, and researchers that simplify program analysis and make it possible to analyze entire software ecosystems quickly (e.g. every publicly available JavaScript project on GitHub). Security issues are an open source public health problem; with your help we can vaccinate the community against entire classes of exploits. Come join us and give back to the open source community!

You'll be an early engineer working with our designers, security researchers, and developers everyday to create a platform that brings together program analysis authors with people who review and fix issues in open source software. Our backend is primarily Python, our frontend is primarily TypeScript with React, and we use modern web infrastructure (e.g AWS, Docker).

We take an empirical approach to product development, proposing experiments and rigorously validating our ideas. We believe in building each other up and 'yes and...' conversations! You’ll have the opportunity to meet with users and set the direction of the product here.

Narrative I/O | Scala Backend Engineer, Angular Frontend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | http://narrative.io/
Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.

- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.

- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.

- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.

We are hiring for the following positions and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.

NoRedInk | Full-Stack, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers| San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

For frontend, Angular 6+ on the newer products, and a few mature products leveraging Javascript and JQuery. Many databases to store our 200TB+ of production data including MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, DynamoDB & RDS.

We have some monolithic applications though new products & platforms are built using microservices running Docker containers on AWS ECS with some footprint in Azure. We leverage many AWS services – Lambda, CloudWatch, S3, EC2, Route53, IAM, SQS, SNS and more. We also use Terraform for configuring infrastructure, Jenkins for CI, and Git/GitLab for source code. These are flexible (they can and will change) and what a candidate knows for stack is not as important as their ability to think creatively – we can train languages, it’s much harder to train curiosity and intellectual drive.

REMOTE (Worldwide) - Open Source Developer on Open edX - React, Python/Django, AWS/OpenStack (OpenCraft - Fully remote company)
Development specialized on the free software project Open edX, used by and in part developed by organizations like MIT, Harvard, McKinsey, and others, so you’ll have the opportunity to contribute to projects that are widely used and to be part of a thriving open source educational community. See edx.org, stanford.edu or fun-mooc.fr for examples of Open edX instances.

We are 27 senior developers, all working remotely from Europe, North & South America, Asia & Australia. The company is not affiliated with edX, but rather contributing and working with them on various projects. This is a full time position, where you would be able to work remotely from anywhere you want, as long as you have a good internet connection. : )

The Open edX platform is a large Python/Django codebase, with good code standards and architecture. You would work on different clients contracts using the platform. The clients list/references include Harvard, MIT, edX themselves, the French government, and various startups & universities currently running their own instances, or looking to create one. Tasks are very varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working fullstack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.

Most of your work is published as free software (Open edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing most of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.

We welcome applicants of all genders and ethnicities.

You can read more about how we work in our handbook, at https://handbook.opencraft.com/

Stack: Python/Django, Ansible, AWS/OpenStack, React, Debian/Ubuntu, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Elasticsearch, JS, HTML/CSS.

Nice to haves: Terraform, Vault, Packer, Prometheus, ELK, Docker, Android/iOS. We are building a modern infrastructure and having a strong DevOps presence on top of core software engineering skills is a big plus with us.

Interview process: a 30 minutes Hangout with a (simple) coding exercise.

The Trade Desk | Full Time, Onsite & Remote | Chicago IL, New York NY, San Jose CA, San Francisco CA, Aliso Viejo CA, Ventura CA, Boulder CO, Denver CO, Bellevue WA, Seattle WA, London UK, Sydney AUS, Shanghai CN
Hiring: Senior Software Engineers, as well as Senior Front-End focused engineers who are comfortable with data-access design, development and optimization.

You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk's dev team if:

You are a full-stack engineer who wants to work everywhere, not just a small subset of components. Experience / interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes: client-side React & Redux, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, many-layered data pipeline (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.) that moves hundreds of thousands of items per second, and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all.

 You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#/.Net, but specific experience here is not required.

Cool stuff about TTD:

* Our platform processes 9million+ queries per second

* Work with the best engineering team in AdTech

* The combination of huge data sets, high throughput, low latency and amazing scale means that we're constantly solving some of the biggest challenges in computer science.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

[3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Engineering Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area.

US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa.

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

Aquabyte | San Francisco, CA | Full Time | Software Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer / Deep Learning Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer | ONSITE, VISA https://jobs.lever.co/aquabyte/
Aquabyte (https://www.aquabyte.ai, backed by NEA and Costanoa, top tier investors) is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.

Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.

Waldo Photos | Senior Software Engineers, Intern/Junior Engineer  | Full-Time | Austin, TX or REMOTE (Globally)
Waldo Photos (https://waldophotos.com/) is a photo finding platform utilizing facial and object recognition to empower consumers to toss their selfie sticks, put their phones back in their pockets and live in the moment. Waldo is the only platform that removes all of the friction in getting photos of you taken by others and creates new opportunities for photographers to market and sell their photos. Users can enjoy life’s most precious events and automatically receive images taken of them right on their phones or share images of others they’ve taken without having to lift a finger – whether between friends and family or a professional photographer.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself. And while camps and schools have been the first areas that Waldo has gained traction, the challenge of matching and delivery of the photos you care about is luckily not limited to just summer camps and schools which is further driving our product and market growth.

To meet this demand we are hiring immediately(and through the year) for:

* Senior Backend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/BE760CF400

* Senior Frontend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/7038D86015

* Junior/Intern Software Engineer (must be in Austin, TX) : We don't have a public posting for this right now, but if you have interest please reach out to me directly. This position will be doing production troubleshooting with GraphQL, SQL, Logs, etc as well as building internal tools and automated testing based on your production experience

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact
   * Market Competitive Salary
   * Stock options
   * Unlimited vacation policy
   * Fully remote work environment with a flexible work schedule
   * Startup growth and energy


If this interests you or you have questions, please reach out to me via email using the address in my profile and I will be happy to answer anything. Or you can apply directly via the links above or just send me your resume and which job you are interested in.

Adacado (https://www.adacado.com) | Vancouver, BC, Canada | Full-time, Onsite | Senior and Intermediate positions
You have over 5 years of coding and web application expertise in a senior or intermediate developer role, and want to do more innovative coding and MUCH less mundane operations support.

Adacado is looking for expert programmers to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically.   You’re the type of developer that is never satisfied. You strive to create new technologies/design patterns, and/or completely abandoning current systems and undertaking complete re-builds, using all the latest technology.  You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.

“Fail often, fail fast.”

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges.  Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, and ES6, and utilizes Node, Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch.  We manage an ever growing army of microservices with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise.  You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis.  You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’.  You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill.  You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues.
The Adacado Team
Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit.  We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and  stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget.   All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).
Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit.  Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks.  We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.Location
This is role will be based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be elligible to work in Canada. Remote applicants WILL NOT be considered.To apply, send us an email: careers@adacado.com

New York Genome Center | Software Engineer | New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE
NYGC is not a software company; it is a sequencing lab trying to push science at scale, and needs software to do so. We are hungry to become the lead sequencing firm. We're aggressively building our clinical services, so if you have even the smallest allergy to documentation or process, please stop reading now.

These positions is for the Production Software Engineering group, which currently has twelve people. We're replacing prototypes with better solutions while rolling out new applications to help the organization with scale. People who join NYGC software are expected to learn quickly, be self-motivated, and be comfortable switching tracks. You don't have to understand e.g. genome sequence alignment, but you do have to be able to read a manual on a tool's use and learn enough vocabulary to have an intelligent conversation with an expert on the subject.

We are intentionally boring (https://valdhaus.co/writings/boring-systems/) in our technology choices because our goal is data analysis, not novel software work. We design everything for reliability, maintenance, low cost of ownership, and failure recovery. It is a combination of boring technology and fast pace: we are the computational pipeline team, the automation team, the LIMS team, the database team, and the data transport team (surprisingly fun at >20PB), the customer delivery team. We don't do genomic methods software (e.g. better variant calling) -- we have a great computational biology group for that. This group is focused on making a sequencing lab and automated analyses run at scale.

The lab and automation combined drive some really interesting real-world problems, particularly in the clinical space. How fast can we get first-order cancer screening done for people?

(contact info in my profile)

POSITIONS

1) Principal Software Engineer: Serve as a project lead. This person should be able to work independently and in a team, from requirements through implementation/iteration and testing and deployment. Python and postgresql on the backend, React on the frontend. We're looking for someone who has both python application development experience and javascript/front-end experience.
2) Senior Software Engineer: Serve as a primary contributor. Strong individual and team contributor, familiar with breaking down tasks into work plans, and then driving those plans through design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Python and postgresql on the backend, React on the frontend. We're looking for someone who has either strong python application development experience or strong javascript/front-end experience and is willing to learn/work in python.

Tray.io | London | System / Backend / Frontend / Engineering Manager | Full-time | Onsite | https://tray.io
We're creating a general purpose automation platform which pushes the boundaries of serverless technology. We allow for anyone, through our intuitive visual workflow builder, to connect their entire cloud stack. No dev resources required.

We are privileged and proud to announce the closing of a $37M Series B funding round. In the past 12 months, we’ve increased our customer count 400%, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) 450% and the size of our team 500% and we are continuing to grow and help business users harness the complete power of their cloud stack without the need for development resource and looking for excellent engineers to help us! Read about our Funding round here: https://tcrn.ch/2vtf4wi

We’re small and dynamic, open to new ideas and the work you do now will have a big impact on shaping how we grow and fine-tune our highly performant multi-billion transaction platform for years to come.

There’s an app out there for everything but most cloud software services are distinctively difficult to use together, and doing so is very labour intensive. With our cutting-edge platform, processes that took hours, or even days, can now happen in seconds.

Customers like Reddit, NPM, Digital Ocean, GitHub, Lyft, and IBM are already reinventing how they work through Tray. Help us usher in the era of automation.

I worked with DataCamp through their course authors program and found it to be a poorly run organization. They maintain a publicly accessible "wishlist" of courses that they claim to want to develop. Think twice before putting your course proposal forward: they'll want free labor from you in a form of course outlines and code samples. After you send these over to them, they'll tell you that they are no longer interested in working with you on the course from the wishlist and ask for other outlines and samples. Courtesy requests that are a norm in the industry, like taking a course off the wishlist while  you are working on it are ignored.
