Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only, select roles only)| $80k-$170k https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.
We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Balena | REMOTE | Product Engineer
Balena is laser focused on a single goal: to enable mainstream developers to succeed on the new frontier of Edge/IoT computing in building fleets of devices that work as reliably as servers in a datacenter. In the process of creating this bridge, we've had to build many and varying tools and services, from cloud services (balenaCloud) to desktop utilities (balenaEtcher), to operating systems (balenaOS), single-board computers (balenaFin), and much much more.

The role of product engineer at Balena is for a truly full stack engineer, ranging from talking to users to solving architectural riddles to learning new technologies as needed. Product engineers are empowered to take on a user problem and chase down its solution to any part of the stack, working alone or coordinating other engineers in service of improving users' lives, without regard for internal silos or barriers.

The ideal product engineer has a wide variety of background experience and isn't afraid to learn to use more technologies when needed, but also is comfortable deferring to experts within the team when their particular skills are required.

If you think this role is for you, please let us know of a problem you see in one or more of our products, and how you would improve it. All who submit a non-trivial answer to this challenge are guaranteed to have an interview with a member of our leadership team.
Drop us a line at producteng@balena.io with a CV and your answer to the question, as well as any other relevant info that makes you particularly suitable for the role. We appreciate non-standard backgrounds and encourage you to focus your material on the substance and not on formalities. We look forward to speaking with you!

We like to move fast and ship often, and we try to break work into weekly deliverables to keep everyone’s expectations and progress in check. We do a quick hangout at the beginning of each week to revisit everyone’s immediate priorities.

Once a year the whole team gets together for an adventure, with past retreats including snowboarding in Oregon, surfing in Hawaii and rock climbing in Colorado.

If you're interested, please send an email to careers@kumu.io with answers to the following prompts:

1. Tell us a little about yourself. Who are you? Where do you come from? What skills have you mastered?

2. Tell us about a project you’ve worked on that you’re proud of

3. Include links where we could learn more about you professionally and personally (website/github/twitter/medium/instagram/etc)
4. Include a recent photo of you doing something that you love

Persona | Designer | Remote | Full-time | $70k-$110k
About Persona

As a new parent, you realize with clarity that time is fleeting. When your parent is diagnosed with Parkinson's, you realize with clarity that life is short. You realize that your most important memories are just sitting in your fallible mind. Our memories are one of our most important possessions, yet we don't use a dedicated tool to help us relive our family's love.

In the future, you'll have your precious memories at your fingertips. Whenever you need them, wherever you are, stored securely forever. We'll share these memories with the people closest to us & keep these precious memories within quick reach for us personally. We'll take a few minutes here and there to reminisce through our memories. Escape. Relive our family's love: our children's laughter, our spouse's wedding day smile, our parent's "it'll be okay". It will all be there, in one spot: deep & meaningful.

To bring this to reality we need to do a few things: We need to make collecting memories fun, make curating delightful with collaboration, & build magical relive experiences. We're building a platform that starts by focusing on Millennial parents, with the intention of bringing along the Gen X grandparents for the social network Facebook should have been: a private family room instead of a public town square. Focused on love & family, not memes & politics.

About the Role

We're looking for our 1st hire, a designer to help us set our design foundation. We're a team of 3 (engineering, iOS, & product).

Role Requirements:

- Beautiful modern design sense

- Positive attitude

- Growth mindset

- Loves working remote

Ideal Candidate:

- Mother

- Willing to help in other areas of the business

- Illustration animation experience

- Sketch experience

This project is being worked on by experienced startup founders (2 startups: 1st acquired, 2nd funded $20m).

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Leads | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa are solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa's team members have worked at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Like our sister company, InstaLOD, we’re enabling enterprise and entertainment companies to create magical 3D experiences in a faster, automated, and scalable way. From military companies building next-generation simulations and data analysis to leading automotive and game developers — our tech plays a vital part in delivering their project.

We're not just looking for coworkers but for stakeholders and adventurers – driven product owners that want to make a difference through their work. We’re looking for passionate C++ software developers with experience in GPGPU programming frameworks and technologies, such as OpenCL and CUDA, GPU based optimizations techniques, and modern 3D frameworks. Ideally, you've used the Qt-framework in past projects.

Fern Creek Software | Louisville KY | Multiple Positions | Remote
Fern Creek is a software consulting company. We build stuff for other people, usually in .NET on Azure but we do other stuff occasionally. The company has been around since I started consulting independently about 20 years ago. Recently I started taking on larger projects that need more people and as a result, started hiring people. Sometimes a 1099, sometimes W2.

This is not super sexy stuff where you will get options that might be worth millions, but likely worth nothing. What you will get is a load of experience on new tech (asp.net core, azure, blazor etc) and a great focus on the best feature of all...shipping.

The job is remote so you don't have to be in Louisville though if you are close that is cool. Set your own hours and all that, I want pros not people that need babysitting.

3 openings right now...
Full stack dev (C#, asp.net core, sql server etc)
UX Guru (more than a photoshop jockey, make the html and css for us so we dont have to)
QA engineer (test all the things, write unit tests, automated UI tests)
Live the stress free life, work from home, build some cool tech, make money, be happy etc etc.

Requirements:

- Fluent in French and good English speaking skills.

- HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS/JQuery

Bonus:

- Interest in fullstack
We are a consulting firm of experts in Faveod, which is a macroprogramming engine on top of Ruby of Rails.
Our typical clients are big french and worldwide companies.
The service we offer is fast-paced projects from top to bottom.

For example: a client has a long-failed line of projects to handle specialized maps, they want an innovative technology with a team of experts to finally bring it to life with reasonable budgets and good timing on deliver-ability.

What we do: we define the request (macro-planning, features required for the MVP), hand it over to the project manager who further breaks it down into sprints, then the development/integration team starts working on it. Meanwhile, the devops sets up the infrastructure. We also offer design with our in-house artistic director.

We don't have offices, each of our ~20 employees are working remotely from France and Amsterdam, in teams constituted of a project manager, a lead developer + 1 to 3 developers, a web integrator and a devops.

You will see your coworkers overs diners, pool-table tournaments, initial kick-offs at the client's and 2 week-long seminaries per year. The next seminary is next week in Martinique (Caribbean island).

* The Search team is constantly striving to improve Search at Scribd in various dimensions - Quality, Relevance, Speed, Costs, Real-time indexing, Uptime, etc. We are looking for software engineers with experience working with Search systems. Experience with Elastic Search is a strong plus. (More details at https://jobs.lever.co/scribd/0de0db4b-971a-4d1d-ac90-9681f97583bd)

Game Closure | Engineer | SALARY: $120k - $220k | REMOTE preferred | VISA ok San Francisco Bay area (SF) | Tokyo, Japan | Seoul, Korea
Game Closure is building the world's most advanced javascript game technologies, including an engine, server infrastructure, analytics and marketing, among other cool products. We are hiring senior engineers who can tackle architecture and APIs for our game technology on small teams of 3-4 folks. Game Closure has raised $50M, and has more than 300M users supported by a small team of engineers <25, though we are very profitable and growing.

We are looking for folks to work on our engine and server technologies, the games themselves, or both. For flavor: We maintain our own redux-like lambda-style append-only database for more than 300M users; other examples of projects include when we used code mods to port our engine from a propriety module and class system to es6. There are numerous projects ongoing, such as first class typescript support to facilitate better tooling and API documentation,  a react-powered webgl-based UI system, and our own in-house ads bidding system.

We have projects for hosted real-time multiplayer gaming, social gaming, cross-compilation to native platforms, and many other core infrastructure tools that we would welcome your support on defining and creating

Here are a couple example reviews of games we’ve built:
- Snake Squad for Snapchat: https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/every-available-snapchat-game-reviewed
- Everwing for FB messenger: https://www.dageeks.com/digital/everwing-dageeks-game-review/
Our technologies and engine have already been in front of hundreds of millions of users, and we're adding millions of new users monthly. This is a high leverage position, and very senior. We prefer remote work from any timezone because we're looking to build the best small engineering team in the world, but we do make office space available in Tokyo, Mountain View, San Francisco, Seoul, and Sophia. For the right hire we will be flexible to obtain a visa to anywhere where we have offices if it helps.

We are also actively looking for folks across range of leadership roles in product, engineering, and operations.

Beacon Biosignals | Lead Operations Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
Our super early-stage startup is seeking an individual to lead the development/operations of our AWS infrastructure, and along the way teach us all how to deliver more robust software.

About Us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a semi-stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks.

About You:

- You're excited to design a service architecture that orthogonalizes the critical feedback loops that entangle our code, data, models, and products.

- You're tired of organizations treating DevOps like an individual role instead of a company-wide practice.

- You're a networks/containers nerd who will turn us into networks/containers nerds.

- You've witnessed the pains that result from fitting square AWS-provided-solution pegs into round in-house-problem holes. Conversely, you've also seen how NIH syndrome can drive teams down a rabbit hole whose endpoint is a shallow reproduction of an existing AWS solution that could've just been employed in the first place.

- You are familiar with the many idiosyncrasies of storing, streaming, and analyzing large volumes of dense signal data in the cloud (e.g. audio, video, domain-specific sensor data, etc.).

- You believe that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture, and that lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. This quarter, we're tackling model evaluation as a CI process, pushing >70TB of signal data (and our processes for manipulating it) into AWS, and developing a browser-based viewing/analysis application for our signal data. Come help us make the right decisions!

Expensify is the most widely used expense management system in the world, with millions of users and more customers than the rest of the industry combined, processing billions of real dollars annually. Expensify has ~130 employees, is self-managed (no VC control), is extremely profitable, and is working to buy back all shares to become 100% employee-owned, intending to create liquidity through internal buyback programs and eventual dividends. As an equal member of the team:


  - Your voice will carry weight on day one.
  - Your responsibilities will increase quickly and without limit, as there is virtually no formal management structure to constrain your growth.
  - You will work on every part of the codebase, without being constrained to any team, layer, or platform.
  - You will receive a fair, proactive raise bi-annually, without you needing to ask.  
  - You will have the option (not required) to travel with the team domestically and internationally multiple times a year -- spouses and kids welcome (and paid for).  
  - You will be provided the best equipment, a personal mentor committed to your success, tools to encourage a healthy work/life balance, and a workplace that is safe, respectful, collaborative, and inspiring.
  - You will be truly welcome regardless of age, race, gender, orientation, or other affiliation.

Some of the cool things we're working on:

  - Concierge, a “supervised learning” AI-powered customer support platform
  - BedrockDB.com, an open-source, blockchain-based SQL database atop SQLite
  - SmartScan, an OCR/human receipt transcription service
  - Next day ACH processing many millions of dollars daily
  - Scaling realtime search across 30 days (16TB) of system logs
  - Cutting edge web/mobile technologies and so much more!
