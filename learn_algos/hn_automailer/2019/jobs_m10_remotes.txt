Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Levels | Frontend, Mobile, Backend developer; Data Science / ML | Remote, San Francisco, New York | Full-time
Levels is a funded, early stage startup working on making a dent in the metabolic crisis. Poor metabolic health is a risk factor for many diseases, and few people have the right tools to create positive feedback cycles with their diet and exercise. Based on our early Beta pilot, we're seeing people meaningfully change health habits, and are looking for people to help build our product out.

We're currently hiring for two roles:

* Full stack engineer. Our stack is currently React / Node / TypeScript + JavaScript / React Native. You'll help us build our direct-to-consumer buy flow, mobile app that processes biometric data from a sensor, and data display site.

* Data scientist / ML engineer. We have a lot of biometric data, and want to help people make sense of it with clear recommendations, anomaly detection, etc.

We're a remote-first team (with people in New York, SF Bay Area, Pennsylvania, and Portland currently), and—while we're excited to build our product—value a good quality of life and balance. Previously, folks in our team led startups, worked at SpaceX/Google, and had medical practices.
If any of this is interesting, even if your background doesn't line up exactly with the roles above, please reach out. I'm happy to share more information about what we're doing and we'll see if there's a good fit. Email me (Andrew) at jobs@levelshealth.com and mention HN.

Aircloak (https://aircloak.com) | REMOTE (UTC+2) +-2 | Full-time senior software engineer
We are looking for a particular kind of person. This job ad might not be for you. May you find a job you are happy in either way!

You like to work independently, you are pragmatic, and you have the confidence to take on hard problems lacking a detailed spec. You value simple solutions over over-engineered ones. Chances are things will change down the line and changing something simple, or better yet something that was never made, is much easier than changing a monstrosity. You should not need or want anyone breathing down your neck to be productive.

With the formalities out of the way, let me introduce myself: my name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a remote company that has built a privacy preserving data processing and analytics engine. Think of it as an SQL database proxy that generates actually anonymized results on the fly.

There are countless challenging things to do in this job. They range from parsing SQL, to doing extensive query rewriting and optimization, to ensuring that all results produced are safe and fully anonymous irrespective of the level of deviousness on the part of the analyst using the system.

The skills we are looking for in a candidate are:


  - Intelligence and ability to deal with hard trade-offs
  - Great communication skills
  - The ability to work independently and take ownership of tasks
  - A desire to learn and improve

The majority of our system is written in Elixir, but we have parts written in Rust and JavaScript as well. You’ll even find some opportunities to write F# if you want that. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus and experience with web development is not going to hurt either.
We do not specifically look for someone with experience in our particular stack. It is our experience that people who are smart tend to pick up the required tools very quickly. Likewise it is less interesting to us what your background is. At the end of the day it’s your skills, brains, and experience that matter.

Our team is exceptional and quite geographically diverse. The company was built as a remote-first company from the beginning, and we really enjoy the benefits this gives us.

We look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to our team!
If you are interested, please write us at jobs [at] aircloak.com

We are one of the oldest YC startups (YC ’06), operating one of the largest Ruby on Rails sites.

We are hiring software engineers across the board, including recommendations, search, payments, Android & frontend-web. In particular we're looking for:

• Manager of Infrastructure Engineering

• Search Engineers

• Backend generalists for Content Engineering

In Amsterdam we are hiring backend software engineers with solid experience in building, running and scaling out cloud-native microservices (preferably in Ruby and/or Go). We value a hacker mindset, clean coding and a natural aversion to complexity (or if you're a glass-half-empty person: an affinity for simplicity).

Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture with competitive salary and great benefits. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance. In general we care way more about your personality and hacking skills than what languages you’ve used so far.

We have hired many people from these threads, including myself. If you have questions you can reach out to me directly at joe at scribd.com (I'm the Director of Application Engineering and happy to answer questions related to these roles - recruiters/agencies: please do not contact me).
Please apply directly via https://jobs.lever.co/scribd?lever-via=VzDSh9ZP1p

Unnamed Seed Stage Startup | Founding Engineer OR Founding Design/Product Role | Remote and Bay Area | Full Time
We are a new startup in the UX design tool space, with a mission to radically lower the barriers needed to build full-fidelity prototypes and products, and bridging the design-engineering gap. The stage is very early, pre-product, but we have enthusiastic early feedback.

The team of four has three ex-founders. We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.

We received strong funding offers from a number of top tier VCs. We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of esteemed angels/funds, including well-known leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer. No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.
If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com. Thanks, we're excited to hear from you!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses

More than half of our developers are now remote, and I'd like to continue the trend!

To find out more about us, check our developer blog (https://tech.simplepay.cloud) or about page (https://www.simplepay.co.za/about)

Location: UTC+4 to UTC+8 preferred, although we'll also consider candidates in UTC+1 to UTC+3 if they have the right skills and experience.
Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud and include a direct link to an open source contribution you've made, or an issue you've logged, no matter how small.

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Lead | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

We want to create economic security for anyone who works for themselves. We offer an easy way for 1099 workers to apply for health/dental/vision coverage. We're also expanding to other spaces like tax, so as to make it financially accessible for anybody who juggles multiple gigs, or is just pursuing a dream on their own.

As a business, we sit on a unique position and have partnerships with a ton of giant companies who want to better serve their workforce. It's rare that a startup has a good mission and a good business, but here we are.

On the engineering side, we use Node, Python, Swift, Postgres, Akka and some cool machine learning models you're going to love hearing about. More particularly on Android, we're moving towards Kotlin at a fast pace (40% of our codebase is Kotlin already, all new code is Kotlin) and we use a state-of-the-art MVI architecture that's great to work on. Your work will be feature-heavy, and you'll have tons of say on its architecture and infrastructure.

We have a beautiful office in SOMA (San Francisco) close to South Park, but we also support and nurture remote workers. We offer fantastic benefits (after all, it's our product!) and you'll be surrounded by the most driven, smartest people I know. We have a supportive, productive culture that's respectful of your own personal time and well-being.

Quill.org | Software Engineer | New York, NY | ONSITE
React / Ruby / Rails / Python / Machine Learning
At Quill.org, we’ve created an online learning platform to help middle school students, primarily lower income ones, improve their reading and writing ability. Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.

Some info about Quill.org:

- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-p...

- We served over 1 million students last year and are continuing to grow.

- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts.

- We’ve been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (to name a few).

As a member of our engineering team, you will be directly involved in building tools for students, teachers, and administrators. We are looking for developers who can take features from a user story to production. We are a rapidly-growing team of 15 working in the Financial District of New York City. This is a full-time role on-site, and we cannot sponsor a visa at this time.
We're hiring: Junior, Mid-level, and Senior Full-Stack Engineers. Full positions here: https://www.quill.org/careers

Beacon Biosignals | Lead Front-End Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
About us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.

About you:

- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.

- You believe that "looks great" does not necessarily equal "feels great", and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).

- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between "DRY" as an important guiding principle of software development, and "DRY" as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.

- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.

- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.

- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.

Outside of the browser, our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. Our nascent tooling for serving data to the browser is written in Julia as well. We're still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack, however - come help us make the right decisions!

Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.
P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!

Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.

We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks.

We’re currently working with some of the world’s top organizations including The Omidyar Group, Gates Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, USAID, Stanford ChangeLabs, Democracy Fund, World Bank, Humanity United and more.

We like to move fast and ship often, and we try to break work into weekly deliverables to keep everyone’s expectations and progress in check. We do a quick hangout at the beginning of each week to revisit everyone’s immediate priorities.

Once a year the whole team gets together for an adventure, with past retreats including snowboarding in Oregon, surfing in Hawaii and rock climbing in Colorado.
