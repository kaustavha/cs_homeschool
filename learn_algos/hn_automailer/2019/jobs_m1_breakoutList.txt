Discord | Software Engineer - Unannounced Project | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime
Hey HN! We're hiring engineers for a low-level systems programming/reverse engineering role. More deets here: https://discordapp.com/jobs/4200751002

Notably absent from the list of requirements is professional work experience or a college degree. If you're a self-taught programmer passionate about this kind of work, please apply! (Of course, that doesn't mean we're not looking for more senior people as well.) As someone who got their first "real" job from a Who's Hiring thread (this one, actually: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1958374) I'm super excited to be able to offer the same kind of opportunity to people who might be having a hard time getting through resume filters due to their unusual background.

Feel free to apply through the website (I personally look at every submission), but if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at cmFtc2V5QGRpc2NvcmRhcHAuY29t or on Discord at cmFtc2V5IzAwMDE=. Happy to give career advice or answer any questions you might have, even if you don't think you're a good fit for the role.
We're also hiring for a bunch of other stuff, but I'm not the hiring manager for those teams. If low-level/systems programming isn't your cup of tea, check out the rest of our openings here: https://discordapp.com/jobs

Quora | {ML, ML infrastructure} {Engineer, Engineering Manager} | Mountain View, CA | Full-time, ONSITE
Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. We are a web-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know.

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past few months we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.
