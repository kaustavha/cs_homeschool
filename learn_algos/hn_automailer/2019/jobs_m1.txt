Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime
Happy New Year, Hacker News!

Y Combinator has a small ~5 person team in San Francisco that builds all the software that runs YC.  We don't hire for this team very often, but we're looking to hire a couple of people now.

Despite our small size, we're in charge of a number of important products.  We run the software that powers YC's application process, software that almost every investor in silicon valley uses (https://blog.ycombinator.com/investor-day-software/), and Bookface, a private community site that is very actively used by YC founders.  This year we launched two big new projects - Startup School (http://startupschool.com/) and Work at a Startup (http://workatastartup.com/).  Those new projects are going very well - we have over 26K founders signed up for Startup School - and we want to double down on them.

An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners - from our dinner talks to demo day.  You'll learn the ins and outs of how YC works, and you'll get to know and learn from hundreds of companies.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point.

We're looking for capable generalist engineers. We care mostly about your ability to write great software; we don't care if you've used the technologies we work with as long as you're willing to learn them.  We look for engineers with great product instincts who can own whole projects from start to finish.

We also offer highly competitive compensation and benefits, including equity in YC's portfolio.  You can read more about our values and engineering culture on KeyValues: https://www.keyvalues.com/y-combinator.
Apply here: http://bit.ly/1Od0T2l.  Email me with any questions: jared@ycombinator.com

Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:

- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

I’d specifically like to work with someone on Fullstack Go and Fullstack Rust - which is less about the respective languages and more like guides to building full-stack web applications with each, including third-party libraries, etc. But we’re also looking to write content about Python, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
(I've talked more about our economics of writing books here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17015117)

Specifically we're looking for mid-level/senior developers on both frontend and backend, project managers, product managers, designers, and QA engineers. For most of those roles we can hire people working in London, Brighton, or remote if you can demonstrate previous experience of doing so effectively.

Our tech stack consists of lots of Ruby (and a little bit of Elixir) on the backend, Angular SPAs on the frontend, mobile apps for iOS and Android, alongside hardware from a variety of suppliers which we integrate with our platform.
You can see the full job specs at https://neos.workable.com, but if you have any questions feel free to drop me an email on jon.wood@neos.co.uk and I'll either answer or find the right person to do so.

Prima Assicurazioni (prima.it) | Milan, Italy | Full time | Onsite and italian language required | Backend/Frontend/Fullstack/DevOps | https://www.prima.it/carrieraWe are a team of really smart people working in a very well funded startup trying to disrupt insurance in Italy by using technology as our main competitive advantage.
We employ a micro service architecture (10s of them are in production atm), Docker and AWS.
Most of our micro services are written in Elixir, we also have some Ruby, Haskell, Python and Rust in production besides a legacy Symfony 2 application, while on the front end side we are mainly using Elm.

We have a lot of automation in place, we run a pretty comprehensive test suite on Drone CI at every push and every developer can spin up QA environments that mirror our entire stack for a given feature branch (this is made possible by having all of our infrastructure managed through CloudFormation templates). All of this allows us to confidently deploy to production multiple times per day.

Our stack:


  AWS (a lot of services), CloudFlare
  OS: Amazon Linux
  EC2 instance number: from ~30 to ~100: we scale automatically a lot of times during the day and treat our infrastructure as immutable
  Infrastructure: CloudFormation + scripts
  CD: Drone CI, Docker (dev -> qa -> staging -> production)
  Container orchestration: AWS ECS
  DB: Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL, Redshift, ElastiCache Redis, DynamoDB
  Monitoring: ELK, DataDog, New Relic, CloudWatch
  Team organization: small cross functional agile teams (every team has at least one person for all of these roles: backend engineer, frontend engineer, web designer, qa engineer, devops engineer)
  Backend languages: Elixir, PHP (we're phasing it out long term), Haskell, Python, Rust, Ruby
  Frontend languages: Elm, Javascript

Zapier | BE/Python Engineer, FE/React Engineer, Test Automation Engineer, Engineering Manager, Engineering Director (soon) | Earth | 100% REMOTE | https://zapier.com/jobs/
Zapier is 100% remote from YC S12. We're just over 7 years old, wrapped 2018 with 200 folks across 20+ countries -- about 75 of those are engineers! We're sustainably profitable and have a lot of cool stuff we want to do in 2019 to bring automation to the masses.

If you haven't heard of Zapier, we're sort of like Legos for the internet -- we help people build workflows around SaaS software or other online productivity tools. We're doing well, but we have a lot of work to do still. I think 2019 might be Zapier's most exciting year to date! :-)

We're also doing a lot of technical investment in 2019 around simplifying and scaling the product, evolving the architectural design, and of course a bit of tech debt reduction (which is mostly deleting code without breaking anything!).

We're also going to be hiring a Director/Manager-of-Managers layer as well as some Security Engineers in early 2019, but the job posts aren't up yet. If you are interested in those, maybe drop me a line bryan@zapier.com?

We're growing so fast that we have to add 35-50 engineers in 2019. Back-end, front-end, devops, data science; you name it, we need the help (including PM and UX roles - see all of them here: https://www.indigoag.com/join-us ).

Our tech stack includes AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (DevOps), Postgres (DB), Node & GraphQL (back-end), React & Apollo (front-end), and Python (data science / comp bio).

We also offer incredible perks. Free lunch (a rarity in Boston), massive commuter benefits (both MBTA and bicycling), fitness reimbursement, ample vacation; we really focus on and believe in both health and sustainability.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 8 months ago I moved to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We’ve hired 3 remote developers so far and it’s been a great experience!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+2 to GMT+8 should be OK.
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

AlasConnect | Software Engineer | Anchorage, Alaska | Onsite | Full-time
AlasConnect is a subsidiary of Matanuska Telephone Association, a telecommunications company which services part of southern Alaska. AlasConnect itself is a Managed Service Provider and has offices and clients throughout the Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Palmer areas.

I run a small team of developers which writes and supports software for both companies. All new projects are being written in Haskell as we standardize our tooling.

QuotaPath | Backend, Frontend or Full-stack Engineer | Philadelphia, PA or Austin, TX | $70K to $140K DOE | Full-Time | On-Site | https://www.quotapath.com/careers/
Happy new year, y’all!

Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.

We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 8 people: 3 engineers, 1 UX and 4 others. I’m one of those 3 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!

Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.

Pirate Studios - https://www.piratestudios.co.uk | Mid-weight Developer | ONSITE | Bristol,  UK | Full-time | Salary range of £32-42k
Pirate Studios is building music rehearsal studios in multiple countries, and we're big on tech in our studios. We're the biggest rehearsal studio provider in the UK and rapidly expanding abroad. We build our own studios that are open 24/7, and all booking is handled online.

We're looking to add a developer to our dev team right now. Being excited about music is definitely a bonus, but we have loads of fun and exciting programming projects in the pipeline. Ideas are welcome and many of our improvements come from people in the business suggesting them.

Our current primary projects are in Ruby, JavaScript (React), Haskell, and Elixir; with a smattering of Rust and Python in IoT and ML projects. We work in small project-based teams on our various components, and we have dedicated (and good!) project managers who help give us plenty of time and space to focus on programming. Our current focus is around live streaming from inside our studios and this would be the project you'd be starting on when joining.

We're looking for someone in Bristol to join the team working in our Old Market office. Some of the dev team work remotely, but all of us are within easy distance of Bristol (or London) and we meet up regularly to discuss/work/beer together. Unfortunately we're not currently able to assist in relocation to this area.

I'm Head of Development, and working for Pirate Studios is the best job I've ever had. I'll go out of my way to make sure you get to build great things :)
Email us at tech-jobs@piratestudios.co.uk.

Varonis (www.varonis.com) | New York, NY | Marketing Demand Gen | Full-Time | Remote
Varonis is an enterprise software company (B2B) that helps organizations better secure their data.

This is perhaps not the most glitzy thing, but I really appreciate that:

- The software does what it says

- It's pretty unique in how it does it

- Actually, genuinely useful to the people that use it daily

- Helps protect basically everybody else on the internet

In short, it's something I feel really good about representing and I think that makes marketing it much easier.

The Inbound group is fully remote, large enough to have an actual budget for things, small enough to have some flexibility in execution and be open to new ideas.

We're looking for a very hands-on person who can help increase the number of inbound leads generated by leveraging the work of the existing content and sales teams. We want to build intelligent multi-step campaigns that educate and inform prospects as the first introduction to our company, explore new campaign platforms and make smart data-driven decisions about what to pursue.

I realize marketing jobs aren't usually what gets posted here, but the people who have really thrived at Varonis are both really technical (a third of the marketing team are full stack devs who moved into marketing, myself included) and adept at marketing. Our biggest wins have been when we've been able to cross those two disciplines in a unique way.

BBOXX | Software Engineer | London | Onsite
BBOXX provides affordable energy to off grid customers in sub-Saharan Africa using an innovative IOT based solar kit combined with cashless digital payments. We are looking for experienced developers to maintain and break our back-office solution into focused micro services.
Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071

About BBOXX

Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.

BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable solar energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 solar systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.

Bagel Health (YC W19)
First employee (Full-stack engineer)
Decent cash salary plus first-employee equity (standard vesting)
REMOTE
Work at a YC startup trying to fix healthcare! Or at least improve a small part of it.

Bagel is a new electronic health record for the growing number of doctors that don't accept insurance, particularly direct primary care (DPC) docs. DPC is trying to cut insurance out of primary care. It makes no sense to use insurance to pay for basic or routine medical services; do you use your car insurance to pay for an oil change? There are some seriously great knock-on benefits of getting rid of insurance too. Here's a good rundown: https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/09/25/direct-primary-care/

We're still in the early design phase, and we'll be starting implementation soon. We'll hit the ground running; I'd like to get a usable version out within three months.

Here's the tentative stack: Typescript, React, Apollo Client, backend on Google Cloud (App Engine, probably), GraphQL, Postgres (+ Sequelize or similar). Ideally you'd be awesome at a few of these and competent in the rest.
I'm Colin McDonnell, MIT EECS 2016, the sole founder of Bagel, and all-around nice person. If you're interested in working together, email me at colin(at)bagel(dot)md with a resume and a bit about you and why you're interested! Cheers.

Portchain | Copenhagen, Denmark | Full time | REMOTE | Front-end and full stack Software Engineers
We're hiring two full stack or front-end developers (NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL, Python) to join our team of 4 remote developers (incl. the engineering manager onsite in Copenhagen).

Experience working remotely. Minimum 4 years of professional software engineering experience.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and starting to get traction through pilot projects, therefore looking for 2 new members to join our team.

MIG Global | Cambridge, UK | Software engineers/developers, full stack preferred - any level of experience | UX Designers <= 3 years experience | REMOTE or ONSITE (flexible) | VISA
MIG Global is a technology-led market research insight company. We use our tech to automate and enable, and aim to deliver relevant data and insight to our clients much more quickly than our competitors are able. We feel there's a window of opportunity open to us to disrupt the market research industry which is, in many ways, quite slow moving and traditional.

Our tech team comprises 15 people, mostly developers, along with two UX designers. I wouldn't go so far as to say based at, but we're centred on The Bradfield Centre in Cambridge, UK. However, most of our team work from home at least some of the time, and we have three substantially remote members. We've become quite proficient at working whilst spread out geographically so we're quite open to full-time remote workers as well. On top of this we also offer a 35 hour work week and flexible working hours.

We are hiring at least half a dozen talented software engineers at all levels of experience to join us. We're also looking for a couple of user experience designers with up to 3 years experience who our senior designers can mentor and develop. Regardless of our role, you’ll be working on our end to end market research, data, and insight delivery platform.

We are happy to pursue sponsorship for the right candidates looking to relocate to the UK.

Job ads will be going live next week but in the meantime...
TO APPLY: email bart.read@mig-global.com and I'll set up a call with you. This will also give you an opportunity to find out more.

Stile Education | Software Engineers | Melbourne, Australia | ONSITE Full-time
Stile’s mission is to improve scientific literacy among young people around the world - that is, their ability to engage, reflect and think critically about how the world works. We are a team of outstanding teachers, scientists, engineers and business professionals who come together every day to create science education resources that kids actually want to engage with.

We’re looking for another backend engineer to join our team, building features our users will love and scaling the product to meet the demand from our rapidly growing user base. You’ll work mainly on our service-oriented Ruby applications running on AWS, as well as on the full tech stack that supports them.

You either have a CS/engineering degree, or you've taught yourself the bits that matter. You might have worked with some databases before and learned your B-trees from your hash tables and what a row-level lock is. You've not only built a few CRUD APIs, but you've probably also untangled a few race conditions, and you now think through failure states and idempotency whenever you write new code.

You'll end up working with Ruby, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker (we use it for just about everything), AWS, Protocol Buffers, Prometheus (we’re big on monitoring our app and keeping ahead of problems!), and whatever tools you choose to solve the problem at hand. Haven't used many of these before? That's fine; this is a great opportunity to learn!

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers.

Hinge Health | San Francisco | ONSITE | Senior Mobile UI Engineer
We've got an exciting opportunity available for someone who's been itching to work on a production-grade React Native mobile application. This job is for you if:

- you think TypeScript is a leap forward and can't wait to use it in a professional context (no prior experience necessary!).

- React makes you look back on imperative UI programming as the "dark ages".

- despite all the above, you'd feel 100% comfortable writing a light web app in Vanilla JS.

- you love the idea of directly helping people, rather than mining them for data.

- compromising on user experience, letting users do the QA work, or other similar abuses of users' trust does not fly in your book.

This is not at all an entry level position, and our standard for a Senior Engineer title may be higher than what many people are used to. We'll be particularly looking for a track record of building user interfaces in a professional context – code samples and live demos are a big plus.

Email me directly with "Hello from HN" in the subject line to hear more about the position and to apply formally.

E-commerce Venture [Stealth Mode] | On-site at our Santa Monica, Los Angeles office
We are reimagining the e-commerce paradigm. Help us build a new platform to connect buyers with trusted sellers and improve the online-shopping experience.
We’re hiring senior front/back-end engineers and product designers. You should be a self-starter; the ideal candidate is comfortable wearing many hats in a fast-paced, startup environment. We’re building a next generation e-commerce platform, so prior experience in the e-commerce domain or a startup is a plus.

This is an exciting opportunity to come in as one of the earliest members of the company and play a pivotal role in building the technology, team, and culture from the ground up.

Details are light since we’re still in stealth mode, but we have raised funding from VCs who have invested in companies like Nest, Bonobos, and Snap. If you’re interested, please send me an email with a brief note and a link to your portfolio.

Daisee | Product Manager - Product Designer - UX specialists | Melbourne | Onsite | Fulltime
Daisee is building (among other things) call centre analytics software. We've raised over $8m and are well established with a staff of 40 people. The development team is roughly 10 engineers plus a few data scientists.

For each of these roles the more experience you have in call centres the better; for the product designer and UX roles there's a chance that you might end up supporting other applications we are developing, so call centre experience isn't super-important. Product experience with AI applications (natural language processing and machine learning) would be helpful as well.

For the right candidate we would consider someone working out of our Sydney (St Leonard's) office, but ideally you would be working from Melbourne (Cremorne).

Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.

Over 17 years, our pioneering team has made BlueSky the UK's leading performance management tool in the field of education. BlueSky is a web-based software product that drives professional development for tens of thousands of teachers.

You will be our first in-house engineer. You will gradually take charge of engineering practice that we've successfully contracted out for 17 years. In the long term we will look to you to set standards for future engineers and help recruit a larger team. There is the opportunity for this to become an executive level role within 12-24 months.

Responsibilities
Responsibilities:

You'll be reporting to the Managing Director, Denise Inwood, who also designed and specified the BlueSky software.

In the short term, you will need to take ownership of our 50,000 line Rails 3 code base and deliver improvements alongside our outsourcing partner.

Orbit | Frontend with some full stack | Onsite | Full time | React, Typescript, Electron
Post-funding, pre-market startup, you are the first to join so this is ideally a first-developer or even co-founder type role with appropriate responsibility/equity depending.

Let's build a better app platform. To start, by focusing on companies' knowledge based apps. Think: unified search, profiles, and company vocabulary.

But let's make it fun. Using a novel OCR engine we're realizing a leap in computing: the augmented OS; Orbit understands every word on screen in realtime (with <1% battery hit), uses new NLP to sort it into your history by topics/interests. You can organize knowledge using the various apps, or just see context to whatever you're looking at currently using a slick dropdown with quick actions.

And thats just the start. It can eventually power some impressive things down the road from relevancy based on activity to company news based on disambiguated "attention ranking".

Don't you wish desktop apps:

- Stored data in a standardized format using SQLite

- Could share and access data separately from the apps themselves

- Could be easily built with hot reloading and using a shared component kit your team can maintain

- Could be deployed without infrastructure using p2p -- one click deploy

- Instantly launched just like spotlight

- Had reactive queries, a beautiful/large/themeable UI kit, virtual lists and tables, natural language APIs, all typed

- Could go cross platform/device easily

- (insert your ideas here!)

If you love programming in general, are passionate about product, think Bret Victor is great, and generally want to try and make a big difference in the world, please get in touch with me. I need one or two really great developers as it's more fun to do things like this with a passionate team than alone.

Data Science Retreat | Director | Berlin or Montreal | Onsite | Fulltime | Visa | Remote possible for exceptional candidate
Data Science Retreat (DSR) is the market leader in EU for machine learning training. We are expanding to North America, we started in SF but are moving to Montreal. DSR helps coders or people with significant quantitative training (e.g. science, engineering, or math graduates) ramp-up rapidly for a data science career - arguably the fastest-growing, highest-demand profession. Our participants have an average of 5 years of industry experience.

We are launching a new product that is a big departure from our 3-month in-person training:

- For a monthly fee (3 different price points), our customers receive a topic that our teachers prepare in depth. For example, an exciting new technique that just came out in a paper and that is really applicable in the industry today

- There's code that implements the technique, but the most important part is that we provide a detailed explanation and references to every bit of knowledge you need to understand the topic. With exercises that are self-correcting (you write code, press a button, get red/green)

- This business model works well B2C, but it's something easy to consume for big corporates that want to train their people on-the-job (the current 3-month retreat doesn't address this need well). It's all very 'hands on' and more advanced than the usual MOOCs. We suspect MOOCs are not creating data scientists, at least not when done on-the-job. If we can demonstrate results, this should be an easy sell.

As Director of this product, these could be your day to day activities:
- Think up methods to increase our pipeline, together with marketing
- Pay attention to KPIs for recurrent business, for example, churn
- Decide which proportion of revenue goes to service the base, and which to invest in R&D
- Look at customer lifetime value (you don't need to calculate it, we have a resident expert on the team)
- Experiment with variations of product and pricing
- Do outbound sales to convince companies to try our service

Email is the universal communication tool for work. It’s where you discuss work, answer questions, and talk to all your customers, vendors, and partners. But email wasn’t made for business and hasn’t evolved with the way you work with a team. So you’re dropping the ball, missing important context, and relying on many siloed apps that make you less productive as a whole.

Front is reinventing the inbox so people can accomplish more together. We’ve created one place where you communicate internally and externally, gain context about customers and projects, and access all your other tools so you can be more efficient, more fulfilled, and ultimately happier at work. Today, over 4,000 companies rely on Front to power their communications, and we’re just getting started.

We are hiring for software engineers across all parts of the stack. Apply at https://frontapp.com/jobs#openings or email us at jobs@frontapp.com.

We’re always trying new things, and you will be part of making those decisions. We’re looking to build more robust pipelines to transform raw, often human-entered data into standards-compliant forms, and to deploy a wide variety of machine learning/AI models in a scalable, traceable manner.

We need several engineers at 2-3 year and at senior/tech lead level. Requirements for more senior positions shift more toward demonstrated ability to architect and lead projects. In all cases though we look for independence, a strong sense of craft, and solid technical skills.

General Process (based on candidate we make small tweaks):

1.) Phone screen for resume

2.) Short take-home problem

3.) Phone conversation about take-home

4.) Onsite with us

Odds and ends: mostly onsite in lovely downtown San Mateo but flexible hours. Free lunch, ~25 employees, growing in a field that really affects people's lives. Diverse work environment with good, friendly people.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure | Seattle, WA | Console Software Engineer or UX Web Developer | Full Time | ONSITE
Oracle has been making a next generation cloud from scratch for the past few years. There is space for having a real impact with your work and this team is one of the best that I have ever worked with. There is a good culture in this team with work life balance and a lot of really skilled and dedicated individuals. I was honestly surprised at how good the culture is and encourage you to come and meet us in person.

While there are many places on the cloud to contribute, I will limit my explanation just to the team I am on. You will be building a platform for user interfaces. This includes things like a reusable React component library, a runtime for console plugins written in TypeScript, and testing and metrics platforms for service plugins. Our team is also building out the homepage for the cloud and starting out some new dashboards. Another branch of our team builds out all of the SDK's. It's a great time to join and shape what the future of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will look like. Help keep our users in focus while delivering top notch technical solutions.

I'll call out two tracks that we are currently interviewing for: 1) Webdev - focused directly on the frontend and delivering features. Needs a few years solid web experience and understanding of usability. 2) Software Engineer - builds out backend services and frontend components. Needs full set of skills and a few years experience.

To apply please PM me or email me at tom.gruner@oracle.com or go to this link https://oracle.taleo.net/careersection/2/jobsearch.ftl?lang=en&keyword=JoinOCI-UDX

BitMEX | SF |Sr Security/K8S/Node/API | On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.
Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.

Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | ONSITE/REMOTE, Full-time | $160-$200K | https://boards.greenhouse.io/thanx/jobs/903207
Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.
Thanx is fundamentally changing that. Thanx personalizes every interaction between a merchant and their best customers, resulting in measurable increases in revenue for merchants and far greater personalization for consumers. How?
•	Through proprietary partnerships with credit card networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Amex), Thanx can reward consumers for their purchases and deliver highly-customized promotions
•	Through our interactive dashboard, Thanx makes even the smallest marketing team a data-science driven expert in personalization - right message to the right customer at the right time through the right channel.
•	By measuring our success based on revenue generated (not opens and clicks of emails)
Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital).
Thanx Engineering
•	Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from successful product companies like Disney, Google, and Facebook. This is an elite engineering team, period.
•	Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform -- adopted Golang, Elasticsearch, NLP, React, React Native, GraphQL, and added 5+ new microservices; all in the last 12 months. And we are just getting started.
•	Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours and PTO policy. We work and play hard -- be warned, when it comes to Mario Kart, we are super competitive!

Doctype | Software engineer with reverse engineering skills / Anti-cheat engineer | Stockholm, Sweden | ONSITE, VISA or REMOTE (worldwide) | Full-time / part-time | https://www.doctype.se/
We're a small digital agency based in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently around 15 people. We have an office in the heart of Stockholm, but our employees are free to work from wherever they feel most productive. We've built https://lemondogs.com/, https://www.gothiaecup.com/, https://beta.esportal.se/, amongst other websites. Our largest clients are within the eSports segment.

We’re currently looking for a software engineer with reverse engineering skills to work with us on client-sided anti-cheat technology. Our current tech stack is mainly Go, MariaDB and React, but the project you would be working on is a standalone client built in C/C++ and Assembly.

Requirements:

* Good understanding of C and x86-64 assembly

* Good understanding of the x86 architecture

* Basic understanding of the Windows NT kernel

* Eager to learn

Nice to have:

* Experience with reverse engineering malware/cheats

* Experience with reverse engineering the Windows NT kernel

* Experience with binary instrumentation

* Experience with hardware-assisted virtualization (such as VT-x and AMD-V)

* Experience with SLAT (Second Level Address Translation)

* Understanding cryptography primitives
The role we’re looking to fill is initially part-time, but may eventually grow into a full-time role. You’ll be working together with another anti-cheat engineer to combat cheaters in video games. If you’re looking for a full-time role, we may be able to offer that depending on your breadth of knowledge. We can offer relocation to Sweden and assist with housing. I’m one of the co-founders and currently hold the role as CTO. Feel free to mail me at mark@doctype.se if this sounds interesting to you!

To learn more about who we are, our engineering culture, and whether this is the right place for you, read our Key Values profile: https://www.keyvalues.com/lever

Our open positions:

* Backend Systems Engineer: https://jobs.lever.co/lever/dd9a8568-623b-404c-b853-d6a46ebeb9ae?lever-source=KeyValues

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.
Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Clarisights | Frontend, Backend, Data engineers | Bangalore, India | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs | 8L - 30L
Clarisights is an data ingestion and analytics platform that enables marketers to make sense of and gain unique insights from data coming in from all the sources (analytics, ads data, CRM, Payroll, etc). Our platform is a seamless in browser experience - the users just add the data sources they want to track, our backend then pulls in data from those resources and stores it into our own database. The user then proceeds to the visualisation page to create the required data visualisations.
Clarisights was founded to empower performance marketing and growth teams by creating a platform that gives them insights and superhero powers they have always wanted. Rather than wrestling with outdated spreadsheets and BI platforms that can't keep pace with their growing volume of marketing channels and data, marketers can use Clarisights to independently explore and analyse all their data in a single and intuitive interface. Marketing teams around the world use Clarisights for every aspect of their performance marketing workflow - from integrating with data channels, creating and optimising dashboards, and collaborating with teammates - all in real time!

We have found product market fit and have recently closed a $2M round from top European VC's. Currently a team of 20 people looking to scale.

Clarisights | Frontend, Backend, Data engineers | Bangalore, India | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs | 8L - 30L
Clarisights is an data ingestion and analytics platform that enables marketers to make sense of and gain unique insights from data coming in from all the sources (analytics, ads data, CRM, Payroll, etc). Our platform is a seamless in browser experience - the users just add the data sources they want to track, our backend then pulls in data from those resources and stores it into our own database. The user then proceeds to the visualisation page to create the required data visualisations.

Clarisights was founded to empower performance marketing and growth teams by creating a platform that gives them insights and superhero powers they have always wanted. Rather than wrestling with outdated spreadsheets and BI platforms that can't keep pace with their growing volume of marketing channels and data, marketers can use Clarisights to independently explore and analyse all their data in a single and intuitive interface. Marketing teams around the world use Clarisights for every aspect of their performance marketing workflow - from integrating with data channels, creating and optimising dashboards, and collaborating with teammates - all in real time!

We have found product market fit and have recently closed a $2M round from top European VC's. Currently a team of 20 people looking to scale.

We're looking for frontend, backend and data engineers at all levels (Architects, senior, mid-level and interns). https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs

Spring Discovery | Data Scientist / Applied ML | Full-Time | SF Bay Area | ONSITE
Spring Discovery is applying machine learning to accelerate the discovery of therapies for aging and its many related diseases. Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases — by understanding and treating the biological damage accumulated as we age, we can find powerful new therapies for fighting disease and living healthier, longer lives.

Over the past few decades, an unignorable amount of evidence has piled up from the best labs in the world that this is possible [1]. But translating the science to real therapies has been challenging in a field that has historically struggled to experiment quickly. Here’s more on our mission and approach: https://medium.com/spring-discovery/accelerating-the-discovery-of-therapies-for-aging-and-its-related-diseases-7c6a2109189f

We have deep support from top-notch investors, including General Catalyst, First Round, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Felicis, Caffeinated Capital, Sam Altman, and more [2]. And our advisory board includes both world leaders in aging research and senior pharma execs.

We have the beginnings of a great data pipeline (already several TB of rich biological data collected specifically for ML purposes) and are in the process of building out our own automated lab to scale things up even more. We’re looking to add to our early team with experienced data scientists or applied ML engineers who would enjoy working on things ranging from data infrastructure to modelling to statistical analysis of large datasets. Yes, you belong even if you don't have a bio background — we're a cross-functional team. (Although of course biology experience is a plus).

They rely on Pachyderm to do the heavy lifting so they can focus on the business logic in their data pipelines.

Check us out at:

https://pachyderm.com/

http://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm

We think it would be containerized, modular, and easy enough for a single person to use while still being scalable enough for a whole company.

NEAR Protocol | Developer Evangelist | San Francisco | Full-time | ONSITE
## About the Role

As a developer evangelist, your mission is to educate and engage early adopters and the broader developer community about the NEAR platform by telling a compelling story and backing it up with practical examples.  That means doing whatever it takes to bring them into our developer community and keep them actively and happily building within it while learning from their experiences.

Practically speaking, this means that you will wear a lot of hats.  As the core protocol is developed, you will be a key interface with the early adopter community to make sure they will have a great experience on the platform when it is released.  You’ll need to build developer tools, write demos/tutorials and otherwise do pretty much whatever it takes to ensure developers have a great experience onboarding to and using the platform.

Going forward, you will be a visible presence representing NEAR in communities around the world by working directly with our events and community teams.  This means everything from speaking to hosting workshops to supporting developers at events. You are the voice of the community to our internal team as well, helping to inform the development and education roadmaps.

This is a role that will allow you to build real software and also take a public-facing role representing the platform to developer communities.  It is one part engineering, one part community and one part education with a sprinkle of marketing and PR. You will be based in San Francisco but travel is a necessary component to support events around the world.

Apply at https://nearprotocol.com/careers?gh_jid=4106601002

## About NEAR

NEAR is a scalable blockchain and smart contract platform designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption.  Unlike other next generation blockchains, this network’s performance both scales with the total number of nodes and allows those nodes to be run on low-end devices like mobile phones, bringing potentially billions of them into the network and providing a direct path to end users.

6. An understanding of automated testing and when it’s an asset and when it’s a liability.

7. Clear, concise coding skills. Your code is more often described as "clean and elegant" than "clever."

Nice to haves:

1. Understanding of formal methods

2. Bash and vi fu.

3. Mypy and static typing experience in Python.

4. React experience.

5. Django experience.

6. LoopBack experience.

Clover | Sunnyvale, CA | ONSITE | Full-Time | Senior Software Engineer (Backend) | USD $180k+
Our Team

We are a small team of experienced software engineers tasked with ensuring that Clover’s rapid growth is sustainable over the long term. Our team solves for cross-cutting non-functional requirements like the security, scalability, and fault tolerance of Clover’s backend services. Together we design and develop the core architectural components, libraries, frameworks, tooling, and distributed systems at the heart of our global payment platform.

Our Work

We recently completed a project to horizontally shard our OLTP cluster, which had grown to 10+ TB in size. Next up is building a fully autonomous service for rebalancing merchant data across the shards to distribute load and eliminate hot spots.

We just finished moving our production infrastructure from private data centers to the public cloud in an effort to streamline our global expansion. Now we’re revisiting our architecture, processes, and tooling in order to better take advantage of the cloud environment.

We are actively working on the design, development, and deployment of data pipeline infrastructure to support richer analytics and reporting for our merchants and internal business needs. Our focus is on its security, scalability, reliability, and performance.

We already have a comprehensive suite of functional unit and integration tests, and are now focused on improving our automated stress tests and supporting infrastructure. That involves building the tools to spin up full production-scale environments, synthesize load, perform fault injection, and to collect, analyze, and surface test results to help drive continual improvement of performance and availability.

Our Stack


  - Java for backend services.
  - Python for integration and stress tests.
  - MySQL for OLTP. Snowflake for OLAP.
  - Kafka for stream processing.
  - Memcached for caching (duh).
  - Redis for ephemeral shared data structures.
  - Wavefront and ELK for operational visibility.
  - Google (GCP) as our cloud service provider.
  - Docker for building containers. Kubernetes for running them.
  - Netty for speaking HTTP, behind HAProxy for load balancing.

This is the Clover of today. You can help shape the Clover of tomorrow.

Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/ Position: Full-Stack Engineer, Application Engineer, DevOps, Data Scientist Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, GraphQL, Docker, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS Team: we're a diverse 6 person company (across Data, Engineering, Chemistry, and Biz). Everyone gets trained as a professional taster.
Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products and optimize their existing brands by predicting the optimal flavor, aroma and texture for target consumer cohorts.
Our Services

_Innovation Management_: New product development, flavor profile optimization, & portfolio management (multi-product optimization).

_Cognitive Marketing_: Product description optimization to prime consumers to like a product more by purposely engineering a perception bias.

_Deep Market Insights_: Predictions for emergent market preferences by region and demographic.

The Position(s)

_Engineering_: We're currently looking in two specific areas: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Streaming infrastructure focused engineers capable of integrating the data pipeline and outputs of machine learning models into an easy to use management platform.

_Data Science_: Data science is central to the value and insights we provide for our clients. We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. We are a team of data scientists that understand our clients and turn nebulous business goal into quantitative decision metrics and predictive models to optimize those metrics. The extensive role of data scientists at Analytical Flavor Systems allows us to invest in their education across sensory perception (standard sensory science so they know what we're improving and replacing), tasting experiences (so they appreciate the products we work on and understand how the data is collected), production knowledge, and data science tear-downs (a meeting where the team collaboratively attempts to find and fix problems, try new techniques, and debate the philosophical implications of a model's construction).

Next Steps
Please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) | Scientific Software Developer | Zurich/Lugano, Switzerland | Onsite | Full-time
The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) is operated by ETH Zurich and develops and provides key supercomputing capabilities required to solve important problems in science and society.

The Scientific Software and Libraries group at CSCS is looking for developers who love writing stable, performance-portable, scientific software for the latest HPC systems. We have multiple open positions at both the ETH Hönggerberg campus in Zurich, and at the CSCS headquarters in Lugano. Your work will involve long term projects of at least one year in duration. Projects involve either close collaboration with a scientific collaborator, or work in small internal team working on software for use across multiple projects. Some examples of projects you might work on are:

- Template meta-programming and domain specific languages to accelerate climate and weather codes on accelerated architectures

- Quantum chemical and material science applications used for the prediction of novel materials

- Optimising and wrapping sparse linear algebra and mesh codes for our finite element and finite volume users

- Combining low-level optimization with task-based parallelism at extreme scale to perform fast linear algebra on the world's largest systems

- Communication-avoiding parallel algorithms

Our projects are open source whenever possible. Here are some of the projects we develop and contribute to: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor, https://github.com/electronic-structure/SIRIUS, https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx. Also have a look at the profiles of some of our team members: https://github.com/bcumming/, https://github.com/biddisco/, https://github.com/halfflat/, https://github.com/havogt/, https://github.com/msimberg/, https://github.com/noraabiakar/.

If you have a soft spot for bootstrapped, profitable companies with a meaningful product, and you want to use your frontend development skills for good, you’ll like this.
About us:

Drops’ goal is to turn language learning into a delightful game while ensuring effective learning. We teach 31 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - and received the “Best of 2018” title this year! - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe. We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and have releases multiple times a week. We want to be the #1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 9 million, a monthly active of >1,000,000 and an average store rating of 4.7. You can find us here: https://languagedrops.com

About you:

You’ll be responsible for establishing Drops on the web, from a technical perspective. This means a lot of ownership, which we cultivate by having a flat structure.

You’re a no-nonsense person, who is comfortable taking on and managing multiple different projects at the same time, who has been working in working at a product company and has extensive front-end development experience.

You have been working with React for years, have deep knowledge of everything that’s happening in the browser and looking for challenges in growing a product from tens of thousands to millions of visitors per month.

You strongly prefer static typing over dynamic languages, and use every opportunity to transform code that doesn’t use types into code that does. You generally prefer to use a minimal set of simple tools to a diverse range of complex ones.

We’ve built our mobile app with react-native, so we can easily port it to the web and start sharing most of our code - and the challenges that this brings are of your interest.

You like to have a variety of projects - at this job, you’ll be developing a complex web app, a static site generator (gatsby), and even sometimes helping out on our marketing website, that’s being re-built with webflow.

We want everyone to see the big picture: this means you already pushed your boundaries outside of “being a developer” and are knowledgeable about web product growth frameworks, SEO, best practices regarding retention and monetization.

We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product & driven to grow professionally, than in managing people.

We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and freedom. You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.
Please apply through via the following link: https://drops.workable.com/j/6DC995B44D

Knotel | multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://www.knotel.com
Knotel is a fast growing commercial real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.

Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.

As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are building internal tools to increase our efficiency as a company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.

In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to solve.

We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.

Today we're hiring a whole bunch of roles and trying to triple our Eng team:

- Lead Full Stack Engineer https://grnh.se/91ad31da1

- Full Stack Engineers https://grnh.se/a0d117a21

- Data Engineer https://grnh.se/d5c41fd31

Proda | Senior Full stack engineers | London | Full-time | ONSITE | 50-85k + equity doe.
Proda is an investor-backed, data-mining startup for the commercial real estate industry; we're making data entry jobs less painful. Our clients have been beta testing our application and the feedback's been incredible: https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2018/11/01/proptech-startup-pa...

What about the team? We have a high emphasis on continual learning. If you're not learning something new on the job its time for a new one. Our tech stack reflects this; Haskell and Elm are the main languages. We don't mind if its your first exposure to either. We're not afraid of experimenting or making mistakes. The most important quality of anyone on our team is their ability to learn and teach. Our sales pipeline is miles ahead of our development and we're looking to grow the team to deliver more feature our customers. Since we're still young, working with us means you have a lot of influence in shaping the culture and direction of the company. You'll also a chance to grow your skill set faster than somewhere else.

What about The product? We're building a data mining tool that can explicitly learn a relational data model based on sample inputs. It radically improves data entry and data cleaning for financial analysts. Customers have loved our demos and we're understandably coy in our public descriptions.

This is for someone who:

* is comfortable in functional programming, especially Haskell & Elm; and * is experienced shipping complex web software to production; and * has an eagerness to learn and willingness to share knowledge.

A Typical Day looks like:

* Start off writing a feature that requires elm-ports. These can be tricky, so you pair with another developer who has shipped such code before.

* After lunch you're requested to review a Pull Request that fixes a bug you accidentally introduced a couple weeks back. There's no blame, instead some discussion about how our tests and review process could have caught this earlier.

* The afternoon is spent with the Product guys around a whiteboard. You're helping them sketch out architecture for a complex new data-auditing feature that we'll need to deliver a couple of sprints down the line.

We're far more interested in your capacity to learn then the arcana of specific tech tools, but our platform is largely composed of:


  - Haskell
  - Elm
  - PostgreSQL
  - Python / scikit-learn
  - AWS
  - Automated Testing and CI/CD.

The Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) | https://www.mpi-sws.org/ | PhD applicants and interns | Saarbrücken / Kaiserslautern, Germany | ONSITE | VISA and INTERNS | English-language
I am Jonathan Mace, and I am a faculty member at MPI-SWS (my position is equivalent to a US assistant professor).  I lead the Cloud Software Systems research group, and I am actively looking for new PhD students to join my group in fall 2019.  I am also hiring interns year-round (interns are typically at the late-stage undergrad or graduate level).

A quick brief about the institute more generally: MPI-SWS is a world-class academic research institution located in the German cities of Saarbrücken and Kaiserslautern.  Our faculty are world leaders in many research areas including cloud & distributed systems, computer networks, operating systems, security, privacy, programming languages, verification, and more.  All students admitted to our PhD program receive full funding for the duration of their PhD.  Structurally, our PhD program is similar to those found at US research universities, with longer-duration PhDs, flexibility to move between research groups, and a multicultural, English-language working environment.

More specifically about my research group: My group's goal is to make it easier to operate large software systems and to understand their behavior at runtime.  Our research entails designing new abstractions for building distributed systems, new techniques for measuring and understanding their performance, and new tools for analyzing their behavior both online and offline.  The kind of questions we ask include things like:

* When you put together a complex distributed system, how do you know what it's doing when you run it?

* Is my distributed system performing well? Did I configure it correctly?

* When things go wrong -- like a crash, or if things are really slow -- how do I figure out why?

* If I'm building a new system, what choices can I make so that it's easier to understand and analyze its behavior later?

* How can multiple users effectively and efficiently share a distributed system without impacting each other?

The type of systems we work with include those offered by public cloud providers (Google Cloud, AWS), open-source systems like those in the Hadoop ecosystem, and emerging paradigms like microservice architectures and function-as-a-service platforms.  My group's research has a significant practical element, and applicants will need to be comfortable diving into unfamiliar code bases and rapidly prototyping new ideas.

If this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to get in touch with me directly (mention seeing this ad for bonus points).  My contact details and more information about my group's research can be found here: https://people.mpi-sws.org/~jcmace

General information about PhDs at MPI-SWS can be found at https://www.mpi-sws.org/graduate-studies
Lastly, applications should be submitted at https://apply.mpi-sws.org

Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers-venmo-robinhood-and-other-big-apps.html). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of distributed, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but also want to have flexibility in where they work.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:

You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.

You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.

You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.

You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.

You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

NoRedInk | Full-Stack Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] They used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes. [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with base, bonus, and RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and tiny bits of Rust and Go.

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

Abl Schools | Frontend Engineer, Data Scientist, Support Engineer | San Francisco |Full-time | ONSITE | www.ablschools.com
Technology has made the world more connected, fundamentally changing how we live, work and interact; yet traditional schools have not evolved to prepare students for the 21st century. Replacing textbooks with tablets won’t be enough. We believe schools need a new foundation. That’s why we’re building a web-based school scheduling platform, that allows administrators to put master schedules and daily calendars into a single cloud-based system. We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools. We are also a company that deeply values diversity in every way.

View openings, including sales, engineering, customer success, and design on our site: https://ablschools.com/careers/

--------------------------------------------------

Personal note: I've been on the Abl engineering team for over a year and I love it. The mission and the team make coming into work _awesome_. We have a diverse team, we're well funded, we have experienced leadership... I could go on. The interview process is, in my opinion, very fair. You won't be asked to white board and we understand that the process is just as much the candidate getting to know the company as it is the other way around.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me - my contact info is in my profile.

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Data Scientist:

The Role

We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You’ll collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers, and school leaders to build software features that help schools overcome complex logistical challenges.

As a Data Scientist at Abl, your work will immediately improve equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype, with engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.

Recent data science projects include:

Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking

The Team

Our product research and development team is small, passionate, and inclusive. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.

As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.

Responsibilities

+ Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, and predictive models)

+ Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl’s product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production

+ Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling

+ Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools

+ Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources

+ Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate

+ Determine how to evaluate equity, or fairness, for students and for teachers

+ Propose metrics for evaluating the overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules’ ability to meet school leader priorities

+ Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school data

Qualifications

+ Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)

+ Proficiency in writing SQL queries

+ Ability and desire to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences (e.g., in writing, through reporting tools, and at in-person presentations)

+ Experience with cleaning, structuring, and transforming data via ETL processes

+ Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Front-End Engineer:

We are seeking a Front-End Software Engineer to join our team and help build products that support our mission. We are growing quickly and there is a lot to do! Your contributions will have a meaningful impact on our company.

Your Impact

+ Work collaboratively with the Product and Design team to understand the experiences and pain points of schools, teachers, and students

+ Define and build compelling new products and exciting new features that give educators insights that will enable them to optimize how they use their resources

+ Use your extensive knowledge of front-end technologies to build high-quality designs that are scalable

+ Manage code review, increase performance, and communicate best front-end engineering practices

+ Create a first of its kind interface that will progress K-12 schools and their communities

Qualifications

+ Experience with Javascript frameworks such as React, Backbone, Angular etc.

+ You should have a great feel for user experience and an eye for beautiful designs

+ Bring a deep understanding of best practices in design, optimization, interaction, and usability

+ Familiarity with the whole web stack, including protocols and web server optimization techniques

--------------------------------------------------

Support Engineer:

Abl’s Schools team is seeking a data-savvy Support Engineer to ensure customers are set up for success in our product. This person will provide direct technical assistance to customers, assisting with post-sales onboarding, configuration setup, and data manipulation tasks. In addition to assisting customers, the Support Engineer will interface directly with the Implementation Manager and Engineering to contribute to projects related to ETL tools and data solutions. The candidate should be familiar with basic programming and data management, and be passionate about helping schools use the master schedule as a lever for change.

Responsibilities

+ Collaborate with customers to initiate and schedule data transfers from school sites to Abl’s internal database

+ Write scripts to transform, validate and transport data as part of the ETL process

+ Provide first-line technical support to customers and implement ad-hoc data solutions

+ Support account managers with documentation and research around customer specifications

+ Create and update SQL-based reports to provide key customer success metrics to larger team and to inform product and implementation decisions

Qualifications

+ Proficient in at least one scripting language (e.g. Ruby, Python, JavaScript)

+ Experience with data analysis and management (Excel, SQL, reporting tools, etc.)

+ Customer-facing experience in technical role

+ Eagerness to work in a mission-driven, startup environment

+ 2+ years of experience in support of technical products
+ Former experience with a K12 edtech company or in a school-level role a plus

Jump.Work | Frontender and Data Engineer | Amsterdam or London | ONSITE (we provide VISA SPONSORSHIP) | FULL-TIME
Hate recruiters? Eager to disrupt the agency industry? Or just passionate about using real data to understand human behaviour, and help people with their careers?

Jump.Work is a Talent Platform in the business services space that applies innovative Behavioural Data Science and Machine Learning to reinvent the way professionals & companies discover and choose each other.

TL;DR

You can either apply directly (those links say either Amsterdam or London, but we're cool with whichever of these locations you prefer):

- Front-end Developer: https://workstaf.breezy.hr/p/7f5f3ec9623301-senior-front-end-developer

- Data Engineer: https://workstaf.breezy.hr/p/421d1648499101-senior-data-engineer

or shoot me an email (I'm the CTO): rodrigo@jump.work

The Long(er) Read

We all know companies that have transformed industries (e.g., Google, Netflix, Spotify) by analysing information about you and giving you personalised suggestions that seem to know you better then even yourself – but where is the equivalent for jobs? Netflix’s recommendations are not based on “back of the box” blurbs - instead, they extract traits from movies and match them to your taste, based on your interactions. So why are we still evaluating people based on their “blurbs,” i.e. their CVs?

We use a combination of unique behavioural data, machine learning, and of course efficient product development, to go beyond the CV and find patterns that humans would otherwise not detect (at least not at scale).

Our longer-term goal is to be not only a preferred destination for transactional hiring, but a compelling, intuitive guide to planning and executing your career goals.

We have just closed a successful fundraising round and are expanding our team! This is a super exciting time to join, as it’s still early enough that you'll help us shape the foundations of the platform and tackle some very interesting problems, yet we’ve already got enough usage, traction and data that you'll have a real, immediate effect on people's lives.

We are very serious about finding the right mix of talent, passion and ownership that meets our values, and is necessary for an ambitious early-stage startup. As we grow, the expectation is that you will too. All doors are open, from diving deeper into a technical speciality, to moving sideways into another area, to mentorship and leadership roles - in the end, it's down to you, your goals and your performance.
If you want to be a part of a big, ambitious story, let's chat!

BitMEX | SF |Sr Security, K8S, API/Node |On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.
Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!
