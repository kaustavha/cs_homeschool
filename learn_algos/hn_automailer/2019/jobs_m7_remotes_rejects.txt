PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to work toward detecting diseases like cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.

Wave (YC 12) | HR Officer | Remote | Full-time | Apply here: https://grnh.se/55935b0f2
The problem: In 2017, nearly 60% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards.

How we're solving it: We're building financial services to work as they should: no account fees, instantly available and accepted everywhere. In fall 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments; we're now processing over 200k payments every month.

In this role, you will be part of Wave's People Operations team and responsible for carrying out HR and administrative tasks needed to support the team.
Key details:
* Location: We are a remote company and you can be based anywhere between UTC -5 and +4 in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, the UK or US.
* Compensation: $45,000-$65,000 USD (or local equivalent) per year depending on experience, plus equity.
* Travel requirement: You will be expected to spend one week in Africa for company retreats every two months.Requirements: 3+ years of HR experience; native or fluent English; and local work authorization (wherever it is you'd like to be based).

Warby Parker | New York, NY | Engineering Manager, Data Engineering | Full-time | Onsite preferred but remote possible
As one of the original "clicks to bricks" retailers, Warby Parker has more interesting retail data than almost anybody else. We run our own supply chain, including an in-house optical lab; we built our own ERP; and, with a strong e-commerce site and close to 100 stores, our omnichannel game is on point.

One of our biggest challenges is getting all of that data into a coherent form and making it as easy as possible for analysts to use it. We're transitioning right now from an in-house PostgreSQL database to BigQuery, and in the process developing more mature data governance, data modeling, and general processes around data quality. And at the same time, we're working to take our ETL infrastructure to the next level.

We have a team of seven plus a Product Manager tackling this challenge, with more to come in the future.

What we need next is an Engineering Manager [0] to nurture this team into its next phase of development. Coach them to the next level, identify where we need to grow and succeed, and make it happen. Let's talk!

Matterport makes a 3D camera and web platform that allows users to easily capture and display 3D models of physical spaces. Check out some example spaces in our gallery: https://matterport.com/gallery

Some interesting facts about us:

* We host over 1,800,000 highly detailed 3D models of real places captured by our cameras, amounting to over 2PB of data.

* We serve over 60 million 3D views every month, which amounts to over 30 billion requests and 1PB of data.

The WebGL team makes our 3D viewing and editing applications for the web and VR. Core technologies include Typescript, THREE.js, WebGL and Preact. The team sits at the very end of our 3D pipeline: 3D data gets uploaded from our cameras, processed by our vision pipeline in C++, Python, and TensorFlow, before REST APIs serve the data to the WebGL and VR applications, which is what the end user sees.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning through software and cutting-edge analytics leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Cavulus · Senior Developer (Ruby/JavaScript) REMOTE· Seattle, Washington, United States · Engineering ( Apply at https://cavulus.workable.com/jobs/1038986 )
Do you enjoy spending time with your family, friends, and hobbies instead of working after hours or commuting?

Consider Cavulus.

We've brought workflow automation, modern data science, advanced interface tools, real-time stream processing, and people together to bring healthcare costs down for everyone.

Zeal | Experienced Full Stack Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE
W2 and Contractor options available.

Zeal is a software consultancy. We work with a variety of companies, of varying sizes, and in various vertical markets. In every case our ultimate goal is to have them finish up feeling like they got more than they paid for.

That means that we have a great variety of projects for you to work on, with different challenges, and different business benefits to the client. This job is perfect for someone who gets tired of working on the same old thing all the time, and wants to be able to change it up sometimes.

Right now, we're specifically looking for experienced software developers who have worked on Rails back-end / React front-end or Node back-end / React front-end applications.

Our interview process is simple, and transparent.

1. As soon as you apply you'll get an email confirming that we got your application.

2. Someone reviews your application for some basic requirements (which are also listed on the application).

3. Next you'll have a short interview with someone, likely our Director of Consulting. This won't take more than 30 minutes.

4. After that we want to get some code to work on. We have a homework project you can use, or you can bring your own project as long as it includes Rails and React, or Node and React (depends on the position you're applying for). And it needs to be on your machine and ready to work on, because that's what we'll do together. If you use our homework, please timebox the task to no more than 2 hours.

5. Once you've got a project we can work on together, we'll schedule 2 back-to-back interviews with our engineers. 1 engineer in each interview. This won't take more than 90 minutes total.

6. After that, we review the feedback from the engineers, check your references, and extend an offer if we both agree it makes sense.

We hope you choose to apply. We'd love to get to know you.

- empower more users and developers to make the web a space and tool that is defined by collaboration, consent, privacy, security, synergy and freedom

## For the role of Frontend Engineer, we are looking for someone who will:

- lead the development of front end features 
- facilitate growth of open source community contributions to MetaMask

Hi! I’m looking for a technical person to work with me on an early stage startup.
I’m building a system which invests startups' cash reserves in safe, highly liquid money market funds which yield over two percent annual interest, allowing them to grow their reserves without compromising access to funds. Furthermore, the system integrates checking accounts which allow startups to process transactions quickly and easily, and offers an intuitive online interface which allows them to track their progress through key metrics such as net cash flow, burn rate, and predicted runway.

We’re just beginning development so you have the ability to make a real impact on our systems and work in an agile environment.

Experience with building web applications with complex interfaces, backend systems, and security is important. Languages to know include frontend ones such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and JQuery, as well as backend ones such as PHP, Java, and C++. We’re flexible with the exact languages you know but you should be able to build complex web apps which can handle a large user base.

Experience with building highly secure systems is very important, since this is a financial services system potentially holding millions of dollars and therefore having serious consequences if hacked.

Ability to work quickly while still doing amazing work is also super important. Some people can get the job done by a deadline, but it’s not clean code. Others can write clean code but not meet the deadline. I’m looking for someone who can write beautiful code and beat the deadline doing it.

Do things which leave me wondering how it was even possible for you to do them. Surprise me, in the best possible way.

With every person I add to the team, I’m looking for someone smarter than anyone already on it. Basically, each new team member increases the average individual intelligence level of the team. I’m looking forward to working with people who meet and exceed that bar!

We are based in the Houston area. Local programmers are preferred but remote is perfectly acceptable.

Interns, students, etc. are very welcome. This is a very early stage company so compensation would be a significant amount of equity rather than cash, so I don’t expect people with cash obligations to work here full time (but feel free to contact me to work on this as a side project).

This is almost a cofounder role. You get to build a great company here, while doing great technical work.

You can reach me at ashutoshraiofficial@gmail.com.
Looking forward to working with the best and the brightest!

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

================

We're the fastest growing unicorn you've never heard of [0] and was just recently named CNBCs Most Disruptive Business beating out Airbnb, Stripe, Flexport, and more [3].

Our group is working on the Uber for Agriculture. We're developing a Transportation network to connect farmers with preferred carriers (trucks) to help them ship millions of bushels of grain across the United States. It's like a real world Traveling Salesman Problem with even more requirements.

We're growing so fast that I have to hire another 10 engineers just for my group in 2019. Back-end, front-end, mobile... you name it, we need the help (see all of them here: https://www.indigoag.com/join-us ).

Our tech stack includes AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (DevOps), Postgres (DB), Node & GraphQL (back-end), React & Apollo (front-end), and Python (data science / comp bio).

We also offer incredible perks. Free lunch (a rarity in Boston), massive commuter benefits (both MBTA and bicycling), fitness reimbursement, ample vacation; we really focus on and believe in both health and sustainability.

I'd be happy to tell you more, so feel free to PM me and I'll personally refer you to the company.

Manulife University | Int & Sr Software Engineer | 85K – 150K + Annual bonus up to 14% of salary | Waterloo & Montreal | ON-SITE | Full-time
Want to redefine enterprise education and help transform a global giant in the insurance/financial services industry?

Manulife (https://www.manulife.com) is investing heavily in continuous learning for its workforce and we are looking for talented software engineers to join our Manulife University team to teach, inspire and invent.  Manulife University or MU, as we like to call it, behaves very much like an educational institution, but within a corporate environment. We have onsite classrooms in multiple continents and MU students are expected to do nothing but learn while in class, which means no day to day distractions like team meetings, emails and so forth.

For four weeks straight, five days a week, eight hours a day, we teach students how to create microservice applications with NodeJS, how to create front-end apps with React and Redux, and much more.  And if you are wondering what our curriculum currently looks like, the following is just some of the modern technologies that we teach:

JavaScript (ES6), React, Redux, NodeJS, GraphQL, and Microservice Architecture

We are also always looking for new technologies and methodologies to teach, which will allow us to stay competitive and to attract/retain talent.  With MU, we are unlocking the secrets for how we can provide continuous learning at scale, that can be done in a way that makes business sense.  There are still a lot of challenges ahead of us and new technologies and processes that will need to be invented, but the future looks bright for continuous learning.

In the future we can see employees not only negotiating for vacation days, but for education days as well.  What we are trying to do with MU is truly ambitious, but we need talented software engineers with an entrepreneurial spirit, that can speak with credibility, confidence and humility, to help us make this happen.  If you are the type of software engineer that sees problems as opportunities and can speak with confidence in-front of one or a hundred, we’d love to hear from you.

We know we are not in the same tech league as giants like Google or Amazon, but we can offer you an opportunity that they can’t.  What they can’t do is provide you with an opportunity to help redefine enterprise education and transform a global giant with close to one trillion dollars in assets.  By joining the MU team, you’ll have a once in a life-time opportunity to help pioneer a new way of learning and teaching in enterprise, that can redefine how we work in the future.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with active Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS or TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area: https://www.tanium.com/apply-now/?gh_jid=1610524&gh_src=d2f26a7e1

Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Colorado Springs, Fort Meade, Quantico, Reston, San Antonio, or Washington D.C.:

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

TAM roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support. We're currently looking for folks in a number of US cities as well as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, or Switzerland.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Technical%20Account%20Management&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

Director of Strategic Accounts - We're looking for a number of sales people to fill various roles including, in particular, Director of Strategic Accounts.

These are primarily remote roles, looking for people based in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and the UK.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: I don't find it acceptable if you would accept this as part-time job while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with side-projects or other one single extra part-time job.
