I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with redis, sql and noticed them in the post.
 
I've been in the blockchain space since 2013 and received a full scholarship to attend Devcon in 2018 from the Ethereum Foundation. 
I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist, won a prize at EthWaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. 
I've also helped organize and run workshops at ethereum developer meetups at UWaterloo and worked on hyperledger projects and patents within IBM. 
 
I'm a big proponent of open source with commits merged into 10+ projects including Pythons pip & FBs HHVM PHP compiler
