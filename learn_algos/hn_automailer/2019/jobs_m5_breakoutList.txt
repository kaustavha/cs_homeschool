Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Quora | {ML, ML infrastructure} {Engineer, Engineering Manager} | Mountain View, CA | Full-time, ONSITE
Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. We are a web-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know.

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past year we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.

Recursion Pharmaceuticals | SLC, Utah | Onsite, full-time | We have raised over $80M to apply machine learning to one of the most unique datasets in existence - over 12 billion images of cells under a huge number of biological and chemical perturbations, generated in our own labs - in order to find treatments for hundreds of diseases. Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies. Among other awesome folks, Yoshua Bengio is one of our advisors, and helps our ML team come up with novel ways of tackling these problems.
We’re looking for:

* Looking for Data Scientists both for our Innovation and Assay Development as well as Discovery and Advancement teams. You’ll work with our data, biology , high throughput screening (HTS), and engineering teams to identify and answer questions in high-dimensional data.

* Looking for a strong Full-Stack Engineer. Great opportunity for experienced engineers interested in coding for a meaningful purpose (and a massive human impact) and building distributed systems, web apps and tools for biologists.

* ML Researcher: Looking for a highly experienced senior/principal-level machine learning researcher who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.

* ML Engineer: Looking for experienced Machine Learning Engineer who values experimentation and the rigorous use of the scientific method, high collaboration across multiple functions, and intense curiosity driving them to keep our systems cutting edge.
* Biologist, Computational Biologists, Computational Chemists, Automation Scientists, and Drug Discovery experts.

Logistics: Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiking/running/biking is literally out our back door, and it's half an hour to 6 ski resorts. Great pay, health insurance, 401k, relocation assistance (onsite is required), equity, fully-paid gym membership, complimentary chef-prepared meals, two one-week paid company closures in addition to flexible, generous vacation, 70ft rock climbing wall, commuter benefits, a top-caliber team, and help make a massively positive impact. Happy to sponsor/extend visas, but you need to already be authorized to work in the US--we can’t handle the lottery at this stage.
Tech: 
Data science: pydata stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, bokeh, tensorflow w/keras, etc), a cluster of GPUs for all your research ideas
Software engineering: python, clojure[script], javascript, go, react.js, kafka, kubernetes (GKE), GCE, AWS
Our team of 140 so far: http://www.recursionpharma.com/team
