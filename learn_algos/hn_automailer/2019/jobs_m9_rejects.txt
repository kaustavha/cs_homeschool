University of Michigan | Ann Arbor, MI | Full-Time | Onsite | $52-$68khttp://careers.umich.edu/job_detail/176986/research_support_programmer_intermediateassociate
 My team is hiring a junior/intermediate Research Support Programmer. We are setup as an internal consulting service for the college of LSA that takes any programming job a research lab needs help with. If you think of yourself as a “web developer” or a “python programmer” then this might not be for you. We are looking for someone ready to learn/write/debug whatever the labs need. In the first few years, this will include working with a lot of new languages and technologies.
We are especially interested in adding someone who has experience/interest in interfacing with research hardware: Imagine a researcher just bought a big micro-fluidics machine and a microscope and needs to automate taking images during an experiment. We would be particularly excited to get a LabVIEW fan.

You can email me with informal questions, but the only way to apply is through the link above at the umich careers site.
Note that this job listing ends soon and my close as early as the 6th

FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA
FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web and mobile devices. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture. If things like Rust, app and framework disassembly, or reverse engineering sound like fun, we’d love to talk.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!
Please submit via our jobs page: https://www.fullstory.com/jobs/

newline (formerly Fullstack.io) | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.newline.co/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.
- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.
- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, Blazor etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (3+ yrs experience) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

I usually post this long thing about why we're a great company to work for and I realized that nothing compared to mission and purpose.

So yeah you can read our accolades and I'll reference them below, but the truth is nothing matters more than why we exist:

We're fighting climate change by building better apps for farmers and the agricultural economy.

If I didn't believe this was one of the most important problems of our generation to help future generations, I wouldn't put so much emphasis on this. If you want a mission you can tell your grandchildren about in hopes of creating a better environment for farmers (and really the whole world), we're working on it right here, right now.

I'd love to hear from you and learn more about how you can work with us. Our stack is JavaScript (React front end, Node back end).

For reference, we're a Unicorn company:

https://www.builtinboston.com/2017/09/26/agtech-startup-indigo-boston-tech-unicorn

We work on the most underhyped sector in startups today (agtech):

http://stateofstartups.firstround.com/2018/#trends-and-takes

CNBC named us the Most Disruptive Company in the world, beating out Flexport, Airbnb, and other companies you've seen here on HN:

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/meet-the-2019-cnbc-disruptor-50-companies.html

And our big climate goal is to use regenerative agriculture to sequester 1 TRILLION tons of carbon from the atmosphere:

Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans under 50, but fewer than 10% of patients who need treatment are receiving it. Boulder is closing this gap by providing high-quality medication-based treatment via a digital platform.

Our platform is built on React and React Native. We are seeking engineers with experience in these technologies:

AWS Dev Tools builds the tools that we all use for software development and CI/CD ... at least some of them :-). I'm leading a team (CodeStar) of impassioned developers trying to re-invent how we create, release, and iterate on software quickly and safely.

We're looking for engineers, PMs, and UX people to build this out! If you have experience with different languages (Python, Go, Java, Node, etc...), different platforms (Linux, iOS/Android, MacOS, Web Apps), different workflow tools (JIRA, Circle CI, Pivotal Tracker, etc...), different organizations (startups, enterprises, governments, universities), I'd like to hear from you.

I come from a startup background and the rest of the team has varied skills - you will learn ALOT here.  Unfortunately I only have room for people with 5+ years of professional experience right now but if you have less experience and just want to send me an email, I'm happy to give feedback - I just don't have any entry-level positions unfortunately.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/611/full-stack-software-engineer/

Milyli,Inc | Chicago, IL | Perm, Onsite, Full-Time |https://milyli.com
Milyli stands for “Make It Like You Like It.” It’s the guiding philosophy behind the custom solutions and innovative applications we build for legal professionals.

We are looking for a Back End Developer to join our services team- https://www.milyli.com/jobs-software-developer

Here is how one of our developers describes the project they are working on: We are currently working on migration projects from other eDiscovery systems into Relativity.  On a project level, it's a lot of understanding the client's current workflow and solutions, and what they can get out of using Relativity instead.  Architecturally, it's identifying all of the component parts of the system that is being used, figuring out what the best way to extract that data is (API calls vs direct SQL queries vs other creative solutions), and mapping that to Relativity structured data.  We built a piece of software called Bridge that allows us to specify data in a specific contract format so that it will be imported into Relativity.  I like that between making new tools for different data sources / scenarios, and maintaining/expanding upon Bridge, there's never a dull moment and I'm always learning new things from my peers.

Cardiogram | Senior Frontend Engineer | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE
Are you a frontend engineer who wants to make the world healthier?

Cardiogram's goal is to shift healthcare from reactive to preventive, starting with the most ubiquitous health sensor deployed today—optical heart rate. Every modern wearable, from the latest Apple Watch to a $29 Xiaomi, ships with a heart rate sensor. Locked within that sensor data are signs of both daily activities like sleep and stress, but also major health conditions—sleep apnea, diabetes, high blood pressure, and atrial fibrillation—that affect more than a billion people globally.

Frontend engineers build the core of the company: the Cardiogram app for Android or iPhone. You'd be working in primarily ReactJS, NodeJS, Javascript/HTML5/CSS3, with the opportunity to learn native iOS (Swift) or Android (Java).

Netflix | Los Gatos, CA | Full-Time | On-Site
Our team sits in the middle of the action at Netflix. Imagine what would happen if we performed a region evacuation and a bunch of services weren’t scaled properly - we’d have a big outage on our hands very quickly. Changing the steering for 130+ million customers within 7 minutes and without missing a beat is no easy task, but it is just one aspect of what we think about. Steering and scaling are powerful tools to influence the availability and latency of Netflix during normal operations as well. Additionally, our team is responsible for capacity and reservation management for Netflix's AWS footprint, and we are starting to engage in fleet-wide efficiency efforts.

FLOWER CO. (YC W19) | 1st Product Designer | FT in Los Angeles | https://flowercompany.com
FLOWER CO. is a wholesale cannabis membership club that saves consumers 40% on their favorite products and brands. We are hiring our first Product Designer!

The California cannabis market is $10 billion dollars of which $8 billion is still illicit. With taxes as high as 40%+ in cities like Los Angeles, consumers have little reason to participate in the regulated market. We seek to change this. Thanks to our membership program, scheduled delivery model (not on-demand), and our access to Humboldt County supply, we beat the illicit market on price.

PS: Veterans and YC founders both get free lifetime memberships ($119/year normally!).

Vetspire is an AI-driven veterinary medical records and practice management platform. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.

We're looking for a couple full stack engineers to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. To do this, you’ll be working at every stage of patient care from the exam room to back-end analytics. Some examples of what your weeks may look like: creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time, designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders, or building a secure messaging platform for client and doctor communications.

You'll be working directly with the vets using Vetspire, and talking with them almost every day to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It's an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone's pets.

Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React & React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and increasingly Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

Santa Cruz Bicycles |Front End Developer or UI Developer | Salt Lake City, UT | Full Time | Onsite
Santa Cruz Bicycles, Juliana Bicycles, and Cervelo are looking for a front end developer or UI developer to join our new web development team in Salt Lake City, Utah. You’ll work with a small but mighty team to create great online experiences as we create new, and enhance existing rider facing and dealer facing platforms.

We can offer you great benefits that include 100% paid health, dental and vision insurance, 401K matching, monthly employee events and major discounts on bikes and bike gear. Those parts come with the industry. We can offer you a relaxed working environment, local singletrack, and the opportunity to work with a group of bike enthusiasts in a great place to live. Those parts come with the territory.

But what we really want is what you have to offer us. We want to attract job seekers that are looking for a brand that they can be an integral part of, and not just "a company to work for". It's the individual personalities, and the raw enthusiasm for the brand that makes this place special, and that comes directly from the employees of Santa Cruz Bicycles.

Since we are a small team you’ll need to wear many hats. You will need to have great design skills, the development skills to translate design to production code, and the pragmatism to prioritize getting things done vs pixel perfectness. You’ll be part of the team responsible for selecting and building the technologies to help us deliver the future of road and mountain biking for two of the world’s most respected cycling brands.

Requirements: HTML, CSS, JS, and 1 year of professional development experience. React is a nice bonus.
If you have a passion for bikes, design, and development, please apply at https://santacruzbicycles.applytojob.com/apply/ZmRvyoeHRa/Fr... and be sure to reference hackernews in your cover letter.

Argo AI is developing and deploying the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision to help build safe and efficient self-driving vehicles that enable these transformations and more. The challenges are significant, but we are a team that believes in tackling hard, meaningful problems to improve the world.
We are building a high-performance team that is excited by complex engineering challenges and is passionate about making transportation safer, more affordable and accessible for all.

We're hiring for engineering positions (hardware, software, mechanical, electrical, computer engineering) and non technical roles (finance, project management, operations).

I'm responsible for our analytics department, and we're looking for senior data analysts who are interested in making the world better and safer with self driving cars. The analytics department at Argo is pretty new, so you'll have a large impact. We're expecting you to know SQL, as well as Python or R (or another language used for data analysis).

You'll get to interact with many smart people, and our water cooler discussions are around lidars, geometry, mapping, machine learning, computer vision, and how people drive differently in different parts of the US, instead of click through rate maximization. We're well funded, our management and leadership is great, and in my personal opinion, a great place to work at.

Magic | Full Remote Job | Full-time | Full-stack | Software Engineering
ABOUT THE COMPANY:

Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.

ABOUT THE POSITION:

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

ABOUT WORKING REMOTE:

This position is full remote and you can live wherever you want, or travel while you work with us. As our team is distributed across many time zones, compatibility with both UTC-7/8 and UTC+8 is helpful and willingness to participate in team meetings at non-standard times (such as early morning or evening) for an est. 5-10 hours per week is ideal.

Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.

Bonus points if you've got...
- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins
- Experience within early-stage startups, remote, or human operations companiesApply here: https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hnr

VP of Engineering | REMOTE (EUROPEAN TIME ZONES) | STARTUP | FULL-TIME
If you have a soft spot for bootstrapped, profitable companies with a meaningful product, and you would like to develop a small, super-capable technical team in a refreshing work environment, you might quite like this extremely rare executive position at Drops.

WHOM WE'RE AFTER:

You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.

You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.

You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.

You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).

You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.

You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture - organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.

We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.

You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.

WHAT'D BE DIFFERENT HERE:

We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.

We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.

We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.

We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit.

We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.

We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.
We automate where it has positive ROI.
Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.
We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.

Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.

REQUIREMENTS

Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.

You have excellent technical and people skills. (yes, we know, it’s rare!)

You are more of a frontend than a backend engineer. (we’re frontend heavy)

You held senior software engineering management position such as CTO, Head of Development, or VP of Engineering positions in the past and enjoyed it.

You have introspective tendencies, and you’re looking for a position where you can grow fast.
You can represent the technology, infrastructure, and the engineering team at the executive level.

Squarespace | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Onsite |  New York City (West Village area)Apply here! 
https://www.squarespace.com/careers/jobs/77247
The Squarespace Machine Learning team is growing! We source projects from all over the company, ranging from direct integrations of NLP & computer vision into our products to behind-the-scenes services that improve efficiency in our customer help center. Our team prizes stakeholder-focused development of research and project deliverables while also taking time out for reading groups, conference attendance and Hack Week projects that pursue educational and research goals.

The ML team uses a Python-focused development stack with all the usual ML and data processing libraries. We have a framework for rapidly deploying our models behind lightweight Flask web applications in a managed Kubernetes environment and to thrive in our team you should enjoy the full range of backend engineering tasks that go along with this. You won't be developing ML models in isolation, but instead demonstrating leadership and ownership over deployment strategies, architecture choices to solve cold-start problems, defining observability and monitoring strategies and working with stakeholders to define validation metrics that don't merely represent statistical considerations like overfitting or precision & recall but go further to develop holistic understanding of model success in a broader product development context.

We are seeking a senior machine learning engineer with a highly developed skill set in software engineering, architectural design and experience mentoring junior engineers and collaborating with multiple stakeholders to deliver projects. You should be skilled in the application of machine learning both on the statistics side and the backend engineering side and comfortable moving between the two sets of responsibilities as the situation demands. We welcome applicants with experience in any variety of machine learning or applied statistics context (e.g. quant finance, time series analysis, audio processing, etc.), though the candidate should show an enthusiasm for information retrieval, search and recommendation, and computer vision models because these are at the forefront of what we do.

Squarespace offers highly competitive compensation and exceptional benefits & work life balance. In this role you can also expect a high degree of autonomy to help lead choices in ML technology investment and data set curation to set up Squarespace for future success. If this challenge sounds interesting to you, we'd love to hear from you so please apply! Feel free to use the cover letter space to let us know you found us via Hacker News!

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because rest is important).

Locale.ai | Bangalore, IN| Backend Software Engineer | Fulltime | ONSITE
We are an early-stage GIS startup based out of Bangalore. Our vision is to help companies make better real-time business decisions and solve some of their complex spatial problems at scale!

As a software engineer at an early stage startup, you will be responsible for laying the foundation of all engineering systems. Your day might begin with designing a new micro-service supposed to handle 500 million pings on its first day in production and end with fierce debates on coding guidelines or the best practices for handling data consistency across distributed systems.

Being an enterprise-focused company, our systems don't scale linearly or even exponentially. Every new customer brings the scale of millions of customers that they serve. We need to build robust, scale-ready and fault-tolerant services from day one. Our clients rely on it.

If you are looking to spend your 20s learning how to build a company from scratch, if building systems at scale excites you, if you are mesmerized by what the world of location can offer or if you are passionate about zero-to-one, we will see you on the other side? :)
You can apply here: locale.freshteam.com/jobs
