Intel (Quartus FPGA compiler) | Toronto, ON, Canada
Interested in working on algorithmically-complex C++ code to squeeze out every last bit of performance? Actually using advanced computer science knowledge outside of interviews and programming competitions? Optimizing graph-based algorithms simultaneously for runtime, memory, and quality of the resulting solution? Understanding the hardware as well as the software? Then working on Quartus, Intel's compiler for FPGAs, is for you.

You will work in a downtown Toronto location, with an amazing and diverse group of talented engineers, on some of the most intellectually challenging problems in the world, and your work will directly benefit areas like AI, telecommunications, healthcare, aerospace, finance and more.

I am looking to hire specifically for the Timing Analysis team, which is responsible for one of the most critical components in the Quartus compilation flow (all compilation decisions are ultimately aimed at making the resulting FPGA design faster, and to determine the impact of various decisions on speed you need a robust and efficient timing engine). My colleagues are hiring for other roles. Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents preferred.
Please feel free to ask any questions here in comments, or send a resume to evgeny dot osovetsky at my company name dot com.

InstaREC | C++/QT Software Developer | Stuttgart, DE | Full-Time or Contractor/Freelance | Remote or Onsite
At InstaReconstruct (InstaREC), we’re currently working towards the release of our next-generation photogrammetry and scan processing solution. Like our sister company, InstaLOD, we’re enabling enterprise and entertainment companies to create magical 3D experiences in a faster, automated, and scalable way. From military companies building next-generation simulations and data analysis to leading automotive and game developers — our tech plays a vital part in delivering their project.

InstaREC is a newly established startup, that we’ve introduced for the first time at SIGGRAPH 2019 with fantastic reception from all key players in the industry. Everybody is looking forward to getting their hands onto our new tech.

We're not just looking for coworkers but for stakeholders and adventurers – driven product owners that want to make a difference through their work. We’re looking for passionate C++ software developers experienced with experience in photogrammetry, point-cloud rendering and/or mesh-reconstructions. Ideally, you’ve used the QT-framework in past-projects.

Because everything is still being built, we don’t have a career website, so it’s an excellent opportunity to be part of something new and rapidly growing. All parts of our startup are still moving and you’ll be able to drive and influence the direction of our company.
Please provide an up-to-date resume including sample code of previous work that you can share to Michael@theabstract.co.

Unnamed Seed Stage Startup | Founding Engineer OR Founding Design/Product Role | Remote and Bay Area | Full Time
We are a new startup in the UX design tool space, with a mission to radically lower the barriers needed to build full-fidelity prototypes and products, and bridging the design-engineering gap. The stage is very early, pre-product, but we have enthusiastic early feedback.

The team of four has three ex-founders. We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.

We received strong funding offers from a number of top tier VCs. We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of esteemed angels/funds, including well-known leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer. No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.
If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com. Thanks, we're excited to hear from you!

Tact.AI brings together state of the art conversational AI built on a platform with a razor sharp focus on scalability and extensibility, tied together by a UX-first approach.

Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Lumicks | C++ Developers | Amsterdam, NL | FULL-TIME, ONSITE, VISA | lumicks.com
Lumicks is bringing novel tools for single-molecule biophysics and cell avidity to market, enabling scientific researchers across biology and medicine to unlock new types of experiments.

Our primary technology, C-Trap, can be used to "grab" a single molecule, and apply precise mechanical forces to it. At the same time, one can visualize the molecule using highly-sensitive fluorescence microscopy. Our customers use it to watch DNA being copied by the molecular machinery of the cell, or observe molecular "engines" walking across the scaffolding structures of a human cell. Lumicks systems are currently in use in opinion-leading labs across the globe, including Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Tsinghua University, NIH, Max Planck Institute, TU Delft, and Imperial College London.

We also produce z-Movi, the only instrument that can directly measure the overall strength of interaction between cells ("avidity"). This new technology, based on acoustic waves, could have an enormous impact on research in immunology, paving the way for new therapies for cancer.

We're an academic spin-off from a research group at VU University Amsterdam. We care deeply about providing our users with easy-to-use, reliable software that actively supports Open Data and Reproducible Science. To make this happen, we're looking to expand our software engineering team with additional:

C++ developers -- https://lumicks.com/vacancies/c-software-developer/

Our technology stack (familiarity with all of these is not required): C++17 (soon 20) for the core code, Qt5 for the UI and Python 3 for bindings. CMake builds everything. Libraries we use include abseil, asio, caf (c++ actor framework), catch2, cereal, fmt, hdf5/highfive, opencv, ranges-v3 and spdlog. Our GUIs are a mix of Qt widgets and QML (we are migrating torwards the latter). Our Python bindings are implemented using pybind11. On the hardware side, we have lasers. Lots and lots of lasers.

Moonfish (https://moonfish.com) | San Francisco, CA | Full-time, Onsite Preferred, but Open to Remote
Moonfish is a big data for consumer travel company, aiming to help people plan and book travel more easily and cheaply (starting with flights). While other travel products start by asking departure/return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).

We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA/Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.

Seeq (https://seeq.com) | Full Stack Engineer, Backend Engineer, Support Engineer | 100% Remote
Seeq makes data analytics software for a big market that’s often overlooked by tech companies: industrial process data. Think pharmaceutical manufacturers, wind farms, and energy companies with tons of equipment and sensors. Our software engineers tackle hard problems in streaming calculation, storage and distributed computing, leveraging the latest features in Java 11, Kotlin, and PostgreSQL.

Our company is 100% remote and proud of it. You can work anywhere in the US or Europe, but we require an overlap of 8am-noon Pacific working hours. We use a variety of collaboration tools, like Zoom and Slack, which makes us feel like we’re in the same building together. We have a stacked team of kind-hearted, talented engineers that love to collaborate, teach each other new tricks, and build products that far exceed our customers’ expectations.

Our technology stack is largely Java and Kotlin on the backend and TypeScript, AngularJS, and React on the frontend. The core of our product is a full-featured calculation engine that can perform complex math and execute machine learning algorithms on streaming time series data.

I am not the hiring manager, but involved with many parts of the interviewing processing, and happy to answer any questions. Feel free to contact me with questions at stephen.rosenthal@seeq.com (but please do not email applications to me).
To apply, go to https://www.seeq.com/about/careers

FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Productivity | Onsite and Remote | Atlanta, GA
FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web and mobile devices. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task, and the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

* Site reliability engineering: https://grnh.se/bf7e122f2

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!

PathAI | Boston, MA or Austin, TX | https://pathai.com | Onsite / Remote (US)
PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to work toward detecting diseases like cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.
Check out our open positions at https://www.pathai.com/careers/.

Armor Games | Part-time/Freelance Front-End Web Developer | Irvine, CA | ONSITE or REMOTE
Armor Games is a online community for casual gamers. We offer an online destination hosting over a thousand flash and HTML5 games with new titles launching every week. We also develop and publish game titles for mobile, desktop and console.

We are in need of a part-time/freelance front-end web developer who can dedicate 1-2 days a week toward evolving and improving the armorgames.com site.

The site is currently built on a monolithic LAMP stack with server-side templating and jQuery. We would like to start building out new front-end features using a modern front-end framework (like React or Vue) to improve both the look and functionality of the site. This will not be a wholesale rewrite of the site - we need to seamlessly rebuild small sections (ie, components) and integrate them into the legacy site. Knowledge of both modern frameworks and more traditional ("legacy") stacks is required.
Additional information and contact information is on our employment website: https://employment.armorgames.com

Publicis Spine | New York, NY | Onsite | Visa Transfers | Full-timePublicis Spine, a group inside Publicis Groupe, is hiring a front-end web developer to build a digital marketing tool for our clients. Our clients are large national and international companies.
Publicis Groupe has been in business for over 90 years. Our third group CEO was appointed recently and he is determined for the company to have solutions in the digital marketing arena.
Our stack is Ruby on Rails for the back with Angular on the front. Openings are for my team in the NYC office.

I am looking for someone that _loves_ front-end development. Your tools are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know how the "browser inspector" works better than the average "full-stack" developer.

Good Pair Days | Front-end of Full-Stack Engineers | Remote | Full-time
We get it. You’re in high demand. You’re a talented coder with options galore. The money’s good and the work's pretty good. So life’s good. We understand.

But we also know there's a few of you with itchy fingers.

A rare few of you who want the challenge to build something unique. To work on a challenge where the outcome is uncertain and your skills will play a direct role in determining which way it goes. A select few of you who are yearning for the thrill of pressing that button and launching your latest work into production without the layers of bureaucracy. Those of you who want to test their metal, and if proven, will be rewarded for getting on the ground floor.

It's our mission at Good Pair Days to disrupt a powerful and entrenched industry and liberate the world of wine from the aloof, the exclusive, the confusing, and the pretentious. To open up the joy of wine discovery for the novices through to the aficionados, by reimagining what the wine retail experience can be for one of the oldest consumer products on earth.

To give you an idea, one of our first products is something we like to call "Spotify for Wine". We like to think of it as providing monthly wine adventures, customised to each member's unique tastes, delivered to their door. Where they can learn as much (or as little) about their wines each month as they like. We're a little over two years old, and we've just started to hit our stride.

We're looking primarily for a front-end developer to join a small team of experienced full-stack engineers, but we're flexible if you also would like to move to the back-end.
BE Stack: Python/Django, GraphQL.
FE Stack: React, React Native.Feel free to contact me directly at beto at our domain name.

Guilded (YC S17) | Full Time | Full-stack software engineer | $150,000+ | Remote (U.S. only)
We're looking for senior full-stack software engineers to connect the world's esports teams. You'll be a very early engineer (first 7) at a quickly-growing, engineering-led startup, where you'll be using modern processes and tools to build features that teams need and love.

We're a fully-remote team. We know that many engineers are the happiest and do their best work when they're empowered to build on their own schedule. If that sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you.

Required experience: 5+ years software development, 2+ years directly building and shipping consumer products

Required expertise: JavaScript, React, SQL

Aircloak (https://aircloak.com) | REMOTE (UTC+2) +-2 | Full-time senior software engineer
We are looking for a particular kind of person. This job ad might not be for you. May you find a job you are happy in either way!

You like to work independently, you are pragmatic, and you have the confidence to take on hard problems lacking a detailed spec. You value simple solutions over over-engineered ones. Chances are things will change down the line and changing something simple, or better yet something that was never made, is much easier than changing a monstrosity. You should not need or want anyone breathing down your neck to be productive.

With the formalities out of the way, let me introduce myself: my name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a remote company that has built a privacy preserving data processing and analytics engine. Think of it as an SQL database proxy that generates actually anonymized results on the fly.

There are countless challenging things to do in this job. They range from parsing SQL, to doing extensive query rewriting and optimization, to ensuring that all results produced are safe and fully anonymous irrespective of the level of deviousness on the part of the analyst using the system.

The skills we are looking for in a candidate are:


  - Intelligence and ability to deal with hard trade-offs
  - Great communication skills
  - The ability to work independently and take ownership of tasks
  - A desire to learn and improve

The majority of our system is written in Elixir, but we have parts written in Rust and JavaScript as well. You’ll even find some opportunities to write F# if you want that. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus and experience with web development is not going to hurt either.
We do not specifically look for someone with experience in our particular stack. It is our experience that people who are smart tend to pick up the required tools very quickly. Likewise it is less interesting to us what your background is. At the end of the day it’s your skills, brains, and experience that matter.

Our team is exceptional and quite geographically diverse. The company was built as a remote-first company from the beginning, and we really enjoy the benefits this gives us.

We look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to our team!
If you are interested, please write us at jobs [at] aircloak.com

We are one of the oldest YC startups (YC ’06), operating one of the largest Ruby on Rails sites.

We are hiring software engineers across the board, including recommendations, search, payments, Android & frontend-web. In particular we're looking for:

• Search Engineers

• Backend generalists for Content Engineering

In Amsterdam we are hiring backend software engineers with solid experience in building, running and scaling out cloud-native microservices (preferably in Ruby and/or Go).

Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture with competitive salary and great benefits. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance. In general we care way more about your personality and hacking skills than what languages you’ve used so far.

We have hired many people from these threads, including myself. If you have questions you can reach out to me directly at joe at scribd.com (I'm the Director of Application Engineering and happy to answer questions related to these roles - recruiters/agencies: please do not contact me).

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Lead | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (3+ yrs experience) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

I usually post this long thing about why we're a great company to work for and I realized that nothing compared to mission and purpose.

So yeah you can read our accolades and I'll reference them below, but the truth is nothing matters more than why we exist:

We're fighting climate change by building better apps for farmers and the agricultural economy.

If I didn't believe this was one of the most important problems of our generation to help future generations, I wouldn't put so much emphasis on this. If you want a mission you can tell your grandchildren about in hopes of creating a better environment for farmers (and really the whole world), we're working on it right here, right now.

I'd love to hear from you and learn more about how you can work with us. Our stack is JavaScript (React front end, Node back end).

For reference, we're a Unicorn company:

https://www.builtinboston.com/2017/09/26/agtech-startup-indi...

We work on the most underhyped sector in startups today (agtech):

http://stateofstartups.firstround.com/2018/#trends-and-takes

CNBC named us the Most Disruptive Company in the world, beating out Flexport, Airbnb, and other companies you've seen here on HN:

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/meet-the-2019-cnbc-disruptor...

And our big climate goal is to use regenerative agriculture to sequester 1 TRILLION tons of carbon from the atmosphere:

Vathys | Vathys.ai | Lead Fabrication/Packaging Engineer | Full Time | Bay Area, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Mountain View | $120-250K plus equity
Vathys (YC W18) is building transformative machine learning hardware that  will redefine what is possible with machine learning.

We are building an integrated system- a new way of building a computer. Instead of having disparate chips and connecting them together with large wires, we build a single 3D and 2D scale-out system. In some ways it can be thought of as the "logical endgame of 2.5D/3.5D integration". Leveraging this new level of integration also required a radically new architecture and circuit design methodology.

We are hiring a lead fabrication/packaging engineer to implement the 3D integration flow.

Generous compensation will be provided to the right talent.
Please email tapabrata(underscore)ghosh(at)vathys(dot)ai if you're interested.

Enzyme (YC S17) | Senior Full Stack | Remote, San Francisco | Full-time
Enzyme is looking for a full-stack expert with lots of experience in Rails and at least one modern SPA javascript framework.

We're building a software platform to handle the compliance aspects of running a drug or medical device company. Compliance is an ongoing activity for companies in this space, and annual costs per company range anywhere from $100K to $100M. Being deemed not compliant can be devastating, preventing a company from selling any new product for months and sometimes years.

By using our software platform, customers will cut their annual regulatory costs by 50% (on average) and reduce the risk that their products will not get approved for sale.

We are a remote-first company, with an office in San Francisco. Half of our team are remote. We meet up for offsite retreats bi-annually, previously we have skied near Tahoe and tasted wine in Sonoma. Our Employee Handbook is published here: https://github.com/EnzymeCorp/handbook

Enzyme is a Y Combinator company (YC S17), have 30+ paying customers, and are growing our team to keep up with demand. This is an opportunity to be an early engineer at a startup that has found its feet and shape the engineering culture, and you should have opinions on how to do that.

If you enjoy working with smart and kind people, want to work for a company with a goal to improve peoples' lives and want an opportunity to both grow with a company and shape that company's growth, we want to hear from you.

[No name yet - its that early] | Front-end Developer, Visual & UX Designer | NYC, NY | ONSITE
We are a very very new non-profit journalism startup and we're still evaluating names (oh the dilemma of finding available domains too). We are seeking to explore how technology moves through the world, with a particular focus on the impact of tech outside the Western bubble. Through compelling storytelling and innovative user design, our digital publication will focus on the space where tech, culture, and human experience collide.

To build out our vision, we are seeking a curious and talented (1) front-end developer, and (2) Visual and UX designer.

The position will report to me and based out of our office in Soho. I'm particularly open to developers and designers with less years of experience if they have a strong interest in journalism and story-telling and the problems in thats pace. So take this role description as 'aspirational'. If you have proficiency in some of the areas, and looking to learn the others, then go ahead and apply.

Feel free to reach out with question - but you can also do that as you apply too :) (gives me more background too)
Front-end Developer:
https://sites.google.com/view/tmp-/home/frontend-developer?authuser=1Visual & UX Designer

This will include considerations around the user-experience and interactions and some new ways to think about news interactions. This is role where I could see a strong visual designer with motivation to grow into the UX side succeed. You'll have support and a strong collaborate team to work with you.Email me (donohoe@gmail.com) to be notified of when the role is posted.

ember.to | Full Stack Developer | Edinburgh (UK) | Onsite Preferable| Full Time | Salary + Equity
We're building the future of public transport – fully electric, zero emission, and tech focused. We'll get you from A to B with zero carbon and on a single ticket.

Our first step is developing a fully electric, intercity bus network. This will be the first in the UK and probably the world. We've already ordered our initial vehicles and are set to launch the first route in April 2020. We're going up against a legacy oligopoly who haven't innovated in decades.

We’re a startup. A true startup. You’d be employee number 1. That means you'll be helping us to build our platform from scratch. We're not expecting you to do it yourself. We know what's realistic but we also know what excellence looks like.  We'll work closely with you to craft the product and have a couple of experienced developers on board as mentors.

We're looking for humble, ambitious people who are passionate about building something really good from scratch. You'll need to be comfortable figuring stuff out from basic principles and playing an integral part in the problem solving.

Our Stack: You'll help figure this out.
If you've always wanted to get in right at the start of something genuinely good with some smart, humble people then say hi. Send an email to talent@ember.to

Now, we are building the product around that vision. VCs have backed us, and early adopters have validated the business opportunity.

BitMEX is a derivatives trading platform that offers investors opportunities using only Bitcoin. We are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies. 
Across the globe, and particularly in Asia, we have over half a million open accounts, of which approximately 100,000 belong to active users.
Effectively, BitMEX offers commercial hedgers, Bitcoin miners, and professional and retail traders the ability to speculate on the price of Bitcoin, and to exchange Bitcoin risk, with other market participants on a level playing field. 
Our platform was developed by ex-bankers who were (and are) well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance. BitMEX launched in 2014 and subsequently has grown to become one of the most important marketplaces in the crypto space. 
Our hottest positions are listed below. Please apply if you are interested in learning more.

newline (formerly Fullstack.io) | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.newline.co/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps. - We guarantee the books and code are up to date.
- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)
- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, Angular, React, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Elixir, Blazor, Data Science etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React & React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend and mobile, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

Beacon Biosignals | Lead Front-End Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
About us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.

About you:

- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.

- You believe that "looks great" does not necessarily equal "feels great", and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).

- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between "DRY" as an important guiding principle of software development, and "DRY" as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.

- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.

- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.

- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.

Outside of the browser, our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. Our nascent tooling for serving data to the browser is written in Julia as well. We're still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack, however - come help us make the right decisions!

Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.
P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!

[stealth] | Seattle, WA | Full Time, Onsite | Salary + Equity
We're a stealth startup in the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence's (AI2) startup incubator looking to make our first engineering hires.

We're working on a consumer product to help non-native English speakers write better by giving suggestions and corrections for writing (helpful for native speakers too, but particularly suitable for non-natives!). If you've ever finished writing something in English and then thought, "Hmm, is there any better wording for this?", then you might enjoy working on this!

You can think of our tool as an AI-powered super-Grammarly. We are post-launch and have a small but quickly growing number of users who love to use our product. Our founding team has extensive technical experience, including background in academic natural language processing (NLP) research. We are closely affiliated with AI2, commonly recognized as a top-tier research institution in the field of NLP (we get free lunches there, too!).

We have pre-seed funding and our looking to expand our engineering team as we quickly scale up and flesh out our product.

Our stack: Java / Typescript / Python (mostly PyTorch)

Hiring for full-stack, front-end, and back-end roles.

Requirements:

- Fluency in at least one of the above programming languages (preferably Java/Typescript)

- Unfortunately due to our early stage we can only consider applicants already living in or planning to live in the Seattle area

- You are comfortable designing and developing full features for production.

- You have no problem working in a dynamic startup environment where the code is immature and the tech stack is constantly evolving.

Ideal:

- You are intimately familiar with the challenges that non-native speakers face when writing in English. Perhaps you or your family members are non-native speakers yourselves.

- You have experience working in production environments and have some familiarity with parts of the stack that are not necessarily your expertise - SQL, deployment, etc.

- You love building consumer products and seeing people say they love what you've built.

- You love learning (human) languages and serving people from diverse backgrounds.
To apply, please send a resume to ron (at) ai2-in-c-u-b-a-t-o-r.com (with dashes removed, that's "ai2 incubator" - scraping bots are getting fancy haha). Please add HN to the email subject.

# JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, .NET, QA AUTOMATION, UX DESIGN, IOS/ANDROID/MOBILE DEVS and more!

https://www.nexient.com/careers/apply

----- My description -----

(I'm a Sysadmin / DevOps person, I'm not HR or recruitment, but my posting here has been approved by the recruiting dept. I wouldn't post this if I thought this wasn't an actually great company to work for!)

Nexient are good people: My experience at Nexient has been overwhelmingly positive, they are flexible, caring and fun to work at. They actually care about the life/work balance too. Multiple tabletop, D&D, console gaming nights are organized all the time. Charity drives and other ways to give are also promoted within the company. The work environment is really nice too, with motorized standing/sitting desks and laptops that actually have enough memory!! Nexient do outsourcing but with US-based staff, we work closely with clients so we're just part of the team.

Nexient are also working hard to add hundreds of tech jobs in Michigan and Ohio. There's a real need for good folks to help us help our clients.

----- Recruiting Dept's Description -----

Nexient is hiring! In 2009, we launched Nexient to give American businesses a more responsive, domestic alternative to sending software development offshore. We knew we could deliver better software faster by collaborating with clients in real time. Today, we’re the only 100% US tech company among the World’s Top 100 Outsourcers. Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.

We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks. The list of current openings is available at https://www.nexient.com/careers. These are full time positions working from Nexient’s delivery center at Ann Arbor, MI. Visa sponsorship and telecommute / remote work options are not available for these roles.

----- TO APPLY -----
To apply, please use either my email address, aclark@nexient.com OR https://www.nexient.com/careers and mention my email address and name, Anthony Clark.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).

 | len: 81 | no keyword match remote: false no email

Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

ColibriGroup | Software Engineer | REMOTE (USA / Mexico)
Colibri Group is a family of brands (McKissock, Elite, Advance Healthcare, Western Healthcare, Real Estate Express, Superior School of Real Estate, Allied Schools, The Institute for Luxury Home Marketing, XCEL Testing Solution, and Securities Training Corporation) that provide learning solutions for licensed professionals in over 20 fields, including real estate, property appraisal, engineering, nursing, social work, massage therapy and cosmetology. Our companies are taking mandated professional education to the next level as we produce tools, courses, and job aides that help customers achieve more in their days and their careers.  We help professionals become licensed, stay licensed and gain the skills to perform at the top of their fields.
Essential Skillset: TypeScript, Angular 6+, Unit Testing (Jasmine/Karma), Experience consuming APIs. Git
Nice to have: Knowledge of relational databases and SQL .NET / C#
What You’ll Do: As a Software Engineer, you’ll play a key role in building and testing new features and frameworks for supporting an ecosystem of common web applications used by many subsidiaries within the Colibri Group family of companies. You’ll work as a member of the technology team to collaborate with UX, product management, QA and other software engineers to define new features, estimate and implement them. Your main duties will start within the TypeScript/Angular framework, which will be consuming a .NET API, which you will have the opportunity to work on as well. In addition to creating tests with Jasmine/Karma and completing peer reviewed pull request into our production environment.

Responsibilities: We practice continuous delivery and work in an agile environment. You'll design and implement critical elements of architecture and application components for common offerings. The ideal applicant pays close attention to detail, is inquisitive, able to be self-directed while open to collaboration. We follow an unapologetic “no ego” release process where fellow engineers input opinions and suggestions on the code you would like to release to production, thereby attempting to ensure the highest quality code is released. You’ll be working on a team that owns the code from development through release into production, for multiple applications, deploying a DevOps model of complete ownership.

A bit more about the position: The position will involve support of several of our web applications. Foremost among these would be the customer dashboard. Our dashboard is setup to serve our different subsidiary companies with the same set of code. It is angular, with a dash of ionic (which we have been slowly moving away from while staying committed to angular.) The dashboard is actively developed with 11,000 commits over the last two years. As a developer on the membership/mobile team we are concentrating on improving our customers membership experience by adding and improving features to the dashboard. Other applications you will have the opportunity to interact with are a c#.net api application, a .net student course runner application as well as older .net internal applications.

We run in an agile pattern with two week sprints, story point estimating, daily zoom standups, and sprint retrospectives. Our sprint planning meetings typical have developers discussing what the highest priority is with direction from the product owner and divvying up the sprint work as the developers see fit. The position is 100% remote, with the occasional in person all engineering meetings which occur for a few days every year or two. We have typically had new developers on the team spend a sprint working on improving test coverage as it allows them to get into the code and understand the code base.
Interested in this job? Please apply here: https://www.colibrigroup.com/about-us/careers/

Harvard Library Innovation Lab | Web Developer | Cambridge, MA | Onsite, Full-time
The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is hiring a lead developer for opencasebook.org, our free, Creative-Commons-licensed legal textbook publishing platform.

About the project: opencasebook.org democratizes access to legal education by replacing $200 textbooks with free, forkable, digital or print-on-demand alternatives. We’re used in law classes at Harvard Law School and elsewhere; our website and code are open and available to anyone in the world. We’ve saved students over $1 million in textbook costs and have the potential for orders of magnitude more.

About the team: LIL is a group of ~10 developers/designers/lawyers/librarians building projects for systemic change, based out of the Harvard Law School Library. Our other projects include case.law, an open database of 360 years of precedential American caselaw; perma.cc, which fights link rot in court decisions and law review articles; and the Nuremberg Project, digitizing one of only two copies of the full evidence record from the WW2 Nuremberg trials. We’ve done side projects on distributed encryption, crowd-sourced fair use advice, interactive art installations, and more.

About you: this is a great fit for a more experienced developer (like me!) who is looking for a low-stress job with high social impact and great opportunities for personal growth. We use Django and Vue, so you should either have experience with those or with getting up to speed on new things. We are a very small team, so you should be prepared to contribute across the stack and to be very self-directed about what you work on day to day.

Personal opportunities: Another programmer here recently described this as the “most human” place she ever worked, and I feel the same way — we’re a small group from a lot of different backgrounds with wide scope to do creative work, so we place a lot of emphasis on making sure everyone has what they need while they’re working here. We each have real support to pursue experiments drawing on our own experience and enthusiasm, whether that’s exploring side projects, taking classes at Harvard, teaching classes at Harvard, making art projects, organizing conferences, advocacy, etc. Many of us have done more than one of these, and we’re serious about maintaining both a work/life balance and an exploration/exploitation balance within our work.

Job page with application link at the bottom: https://lil.law.harvard.edu/collaborate/2019/h2o-developer/

—
(This is a weird one! There aren't many programming jobs, even academic jobs, that pay a steady salary to creatively pursue social impact with a broad, self-directed scope like this. It's an awesome job for the right person -- please pass it along if you think you know that person!)

Squarespace | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Onsite |  New York City (West Village area)Apply here! 
https://www.squarespace.com/careers/jobs/77247
The Squarespace Machine Learning team is growing! We source projects from all over the company, ranging from direct integrations of NLP & computer vision into our products to behind-the-scenes services that improve efficiency in our customer help center. Our team prizes stakeholder-focused development of research and project deliverables while also taking time out for reading groups, conference attendance and Hack Week projects that pursue educational and research goals.

The ML team uses a Python-focused development stack with all the usual ML and data processing libraries. We have a framework for rapidly deploying our models behind lightweight Flask web applications in a managed Kubernetes environment and to thrive in our team you should enjoy the full range of backend engineering tasks that go along with this. You won't be developing ML models in isolation, but instead demonstrating leadership and ownership over deployment strategies, architecture choices to solve cold-start problems, defining observability and monitoring strategies and working with stakeholders to define validation metrics that don't merely represent statistical considerations like overfitting or precision & recall but go further to develop holistic understanding of model success in a broader product development context.

We are seeking a senior machine learning engineer with a highly developed skill set in software engineering, architectural design and experience mentoring junior engineers and collaborating with multiple stakeholders to deliver projects. You should be skilled in the application of machine learning both on the statistics side and the backend engineering side and comfortable moving between the two sets of responsibilities as the situation demands. We welcome applicants with experience in any variety of machine learning or applied statistics context (e.g. quant finance, time series analysis, audio processing, etc.), though the candidate should show an enthusiasm for information retrieval, search and recommendation, and computer vision models because these are at the forefront of what we do.

Squarespace offers highly competitive compensation and exceptional benefits & work life balance. In this role you can also expect a high degree of autonomy to help lead choices in ML technology investment and data set curation to set up Squarespace for future success. If this challenge sounds interesting to you, we'd love to hear from you so please apply! Feel free to use the cover letter space to let us know you found us via Hacker News!

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].
The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune ranked us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5] [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, parental leave, fertility/adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 2-3 times a year, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.dauber@[company site].

Associate/Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, devops, or security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

Adacado | Front-End/UX Developer | Full-time onsite | Vancouver | https://www.adacado.com
You have over 4 years of web application design and coding expertise, and want to do more innovative front-end development in unorthodox ways.

Adacado is looking for expert front-end developers with proven coding and UX design skills. You have the perfect balance of left and right brain, with an eye for great dynamic industrial style and the mind to implement the complex logic to drive it. HTML/CSS/ES6 are second-nature to you, you are equally comfortable with CSS keyframes and HTML Canvas as well as Javascript asynchronous functions and DOM manipulation.

You are very adaptable, and know that there is no single way or right way to develop. You understand that the endsare more important than the means, and the endswill forever evolve and always introduce new challenges. You don’t hesitate to abandon code or methodology in favor of something new that better solves the current problem. You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.

Adacado client-side applications contain most of our business rules, and you will be expected to design, implement, and maintain complicated business logic as per our architecture. Your designs and code will be expected to effectively manage data efficacy, data versioning, and all calls to our various APIs.

As a developer at Adacado you will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new features in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis. You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of constant group learning as we exchange expertise and experience with each other. You have no problems spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill. You understand that the best tool for the job is teamwork.

The Adacado Platform

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges. Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, and ES6, and utilizes Node, Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch. We manage an ever growing army of microservices (150+ unique across 300+ deployments) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

The Adacado Team

Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit. We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.

We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours, and a generous skills-development/education budget. All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun!)

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit. Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks. We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.

Location

This is role is based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be eligible to work in Canada. Remote applicants WILL NOT be considered.
