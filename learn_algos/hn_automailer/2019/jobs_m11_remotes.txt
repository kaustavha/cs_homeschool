Balena | REMOTE | Product Engineer
Balena is laser focused on a single goal: to enable mainstream developers to succeed on the new frontier of Edge/IoT computing in building fleets of devices that work as reliably as servers in a datacenter. In the process of creating this bridge, we've had to build many and varying tools and services, from cloud services (balenaCloud) to desktop utilities (balenaEtcher), to operating systems (balenaOS), single-board computers (balenaFin), and much much more.

The role of product engineer at Balena is for a truly full stack engineer, ranging from talking to users to solving architectural riddles to learning new technologies as needed. Product engineers are empowered to take on a user problem and chase down its solution to any part of the stack, working alone or coordinating other engineers in service of improving users' lives, without regard for internal silos or barriers.

The ideal product engineer has a wide variety of background experience and isn't afraid to learn to use more technologies when needed, but also is comfortable deferring to experts within the team when their particular skills are required.

If you think this role is for you, please let us know of a problem you see in one or more of our products, and how you would improve it. All who submit a non-trivial answer to this challenge are guaranteed to have an interview with a member of our leadership team.
Drop us a line at producteng@balena.io with a CV and your answer to the question, as well as any other relevant info that makes you particularly suitable for the role. We appreciate non-standard backgrounds and encourage you to focus your material on the substance and not on formalities. We look forward to speaking with you!

Persona | Designer | Remote | Full-time | $70k-$110k
About Persona

As a new parent, you realize with clarity that time is fleeting. When your parent is diagnosed with Parkinson's, you realize with clarity that life is short. You realize that your most important memories are just sitting in your fallible mind. Our memories are one of our most important possessions, yet we don't use a dedicated tool to help us relive our family's love.

In the future, you'll have your precious memories at your fingertips. Whenever you need them, wherever you are, stored securely forever. We'll share these memories with the people closest to us & keep these precious memories within quick reach for us personally. We'll take a few minutes here and there to reminisce through our memories. Escape. Relive our family's love: our children's laughter, our spouse's wedding day smile, our parent's "it'll be okay". It will all be there, in one spot: deep & meaningful.

To bring this to reality we need to do a few things: We need to make collecting memories fun, make curating delightful with collaboration, & build magical relive experiences. We're building a platform that starts by focusing on Millennial parents, with the intention of bringing along the Gen X grandparents for the social network Facebook should have been: a private family room instead of a public town square. Focused on love & family, not memes & politics.

About the Role

We're looking for our 1st hire, a designer to help us set our design foundation. We're a team of 3 (engineering, iOS, & product).

Role Requirements:

- Beautiful modern design sense

- Positive attitude

- Growth mindset

- Loves working remote

Ideal Candidate:

- Mother

- Willing to help in other areas of the business

- Illustration animation experience

- Sketch experience

This project is being worked on by experienced startup founders (2 startups: 1st acquired, 2nd funded $20m).

Game Closure | Engineer | SALARY: $120k - $220k | REMOTE preferred | VISA ok San Francisco Bay area (SF) | Tokyo, Japan | Seoul, Korea
Game Closure is building the world's most advanced javascript game technologies, including an engine, server infrastructure, analytics and marketing, among other cool products. We are hiring senior engineers who can tackle architecture and APIs for our game technology on small teams of 3-4 folks. Game Closure has raised $50M, and has more than 300M users supported by a small team of engineers <25, though we are very profitable and growing.

We are looking for folks to work on our engine and server technologies, the games themselves, or both. For flavor: We maintain our own redux-like lambda-style append-only database for more than 300M users; other examples of projects include when we used code mods to port our engine from a propriety module and class system to es6. There are numerous projects ongoing, such as first class typescript support to facilitate better tooling and API documentation,  a react-powered webgl-based UI system, and our own in-house ads bidding system.

We have projects for hosted real-time multiplayer gaming, social gaming, cross-compilation to native platforms, and many other core infrastructure tools that we would welcome your support on defining and creating

Here are a couple example reviews of games we’ve built:
- Snake Squad for Snapchat: https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/every-available-snapchat-game-reviewed
- Everwing for FB messenger: https://www.dageeks.com/digital/everwing-dageeks-game-review/
Our technologies and engine have already been in front of hundreds of millions of users, and we're adding millions of new users monthly. This is a high leverage position, and very senior. We prefer remote work from any timezone because we're looking to build the best small engineering team in the world, but we do make office space available in Tokyo, Mountain View, San Francisco, Seoul, and Sophia. For the right hire we will be flexible to obtain a visa to anywhere where we have offices if it helps.

We are also actively looking for folks across range of leadership roles in product, engineering, and operations.
