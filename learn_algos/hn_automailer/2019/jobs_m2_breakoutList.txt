Instacart | San Francisco, Toronto, Remote | Senior engineering roles
I'm a dev at Instacart, where we're building the world's largest market for groceries.

Lots of interesting problems for senior people in various technologies, frontend and backend engineers, iOS/Android, infra/devops specialists, security, etc. It's wild to deal with the scale we're reaching these days, and online grocery is still a tiny market in 2019 compared to what it will be.

We were also frontpaging HN a lot last week for some appearances in the news, which wasn't fun. It was pretty excellent to see how company leadership listened and changed policy within a few days. That doesn't happen everywhere.
If you're interested, reach out to me - email in my profile.  Full job listings at https://boards.greenhouse.io/instacart

Recursion Pharmaceuticals | SLC, Utah | Onsite, full-time | We have raised over $80M to apply machine learning to one of the most unique datasets in existence - over 12 billion images of cells under a huge number of biological and chemical perturbations, generated in our own labs - in order to find treatments for hundreds of diseases. Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies. Among other awesome folks, Yoshua Bengio is one of our advisors, and helps our ML team come up with novel ways of tackling these problems.
We’re looking for:

Looking for Data Scientists both for our Innovation and Assay Development as well as Discovery and Advancement teams. You’ll work with our data, biology , high throughput screening (HTS), and engineering teams to identify and answer questions in high-dimensional data.

Looking for a strong Data Engineer and Full-Stack Engineer. Great opportunity for experienced engineers interested in coding for a meaningful purpose (and a massive human impact) and building distributed systems, web apps and tools for biologists.

* ML researcher: Looking for a highly experienced senior/principal-level machine learning researcher who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.
* Biologists, computational biologists, computational chemists, automation scientists, and drug discovery experts.
http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers for more details and to apply.
Logistics: Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiking/running/biking is literally out our back door, and it's half an hour to 6 ski resorts. Great pay, health insurance, 401k, relocation assistance (onsite is required), equity, fully-paid gym membership, complimentary chef-prepared meals, two one-week paid company closures in addition to flexible, generous vacation, 70ft rock climbing wall, commuter benefits,  a top-caliber team, and help make a massively positive impact. Happy to sponsor/extend visas, but you need to already be authorized to work in the US--we can’t handle the lottery at this stage.
Tech: 
Data science: pydata stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, bokeh, tensorflow w/keras, etc), a cluster of GPUs for all your research ideas
Software engineering: python, clojure[script], javascript, go, react.js, kafka, kubernetes (GKE), GCE, AWS

Quora | {ML, ML infrastructure} {Engineer, Engineering Manager} | Mountain View, CA | Full-time, ONSITE
Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. We are a web-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know.

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past few months we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.
