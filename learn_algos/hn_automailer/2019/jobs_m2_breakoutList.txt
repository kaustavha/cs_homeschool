Discord | Software Engineer - Unannounced Project | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime
Hey HN! We're hiring engineers for a low-level systems programming/reverse engineering role. More deets here: https://discordapp.com/jobs/4200751002

Notably absent from the list of requirements is professional work experience or a college degree. If you're a self-taught programmer passionate about this kind of work, please apply! (Of course, that doesn't mean we're not looking for more senior people as well.) As someone who got their first "real" job from a Who's Hiring thread (this one, actually: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1958374) I'm super excited to be able to offer the same kind of opportunity to people who might be having a hard time getting through resume filters due to their unusual background.

Feel free to apply through the website (I personally look at every submission), but if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at cmFtc2V5QGRpc2NvcmRhcHAuY29t or on Discord at cmFtc2V5IzAwMDE=. Happy to give career advice or answer any questions you might have, even if you don't think you're a good fit for the role.
We're also hiring for a bunch of other stuff, but I'm not the hiring manager for those teams. If low-level/systems programming isn't your cup of tea, check out the rest of our openings here: https://discordapp.com/jobs

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.
