Latacora | Security Engineers | Full-time | Chicago or Remote
You could pick one startup to work for. But why choose? You can also work for a bunch of them simultaneously. That's what we did. We're Latacora, and we're building a security team that runs security teams for startups. We're a weird firm: we have only one kind of client, and we work full-time with them for 6-18 months, doing everything a security team does, from software security to cryptography design to AWS and container lockdown.

We've been working together since 2005 (when we were called Matasano). And for almost as long, we've been hiring people off the HN hiring thread. We don't care about resumes or previous work experience. Rather, we're interested in aptitude and level of interest in the problems we're working on. No phone screens, no whiteboard interviews. More than you could want to know about our hiring process: https://latacora.com/careers

We're hiring 3 roles:

* Secops people, who do cloud and network security and security automation.

* Appsec people, who do software security assessments, watch PRs, and do app design meetings.

* Corpsec people, who protect endpoints and IT assets and put vendors through the security wringer.

Everyone at Latacora delivers work, from the partners on down, and everyone writes software --- so one skill you'll want to have going in is "able to solve problems by writing software".

jobs@latacora.com
Full-time only. Remote fine, but must be in the US.
                      
                  
      


FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA
FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web and mobile devices. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture. If things like Rust, app and framework disassembly, or reverse engineering sound like fun, we’d love to talk.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!

newline (formerly Fullstack.io) | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.newline.co/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.
- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.
- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, Blazor etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (3+ yrs experience) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

I usually post this long thing about why we're a great company to work for and I realized that nothing compared to mission and purpose.

So yeah you can read our accolades and I'll reference them below, but the truth is nothing matters more than why we exist:

We're fighting climate change by building better apps for farmers and the agricultural economy.

If I didn't believe this was one of the most important problems of our generation to help future generations, I wouldn't put so much emphasis on this. If you want a mission you can tell your grandchildren about in hopes of creating a better environment for farmers (and really the whole world), we're working on it right here, right now.

I'd love to hear from you and learn more about how you can work with us. Our stack is JavaScript (React front end, Node back end).

For reference, we're a Unicorn company:

https://www.builtinboston.com/2017/09/26/agtech-startup-indigo-boston-tech-unicorn

We work on the most underhyped sector in startups today (agtech):

http://stateofstartups.firstround.com/2018/#trends-and-takes

CNBC named us the Most Disruptive Company in the world, beating out Flexport, Airbnb, and other companies you've seen here on HN:

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/meet-the-2019-cnbc-disruptor-50-companies.html

And our big climate goal is to use regenerative agriculture to sequester 1 TRILLION tons of carbon from the atmosphere:

Evidation Health | Santa Barbara, SF, San Mateo | Full time and Interns | ONSITE or REMOTE | https://evidation.com/careers/
Evidation runs health studies combining digital data with traditional markers.  In addition we run a "why don't you build some good habits" consumer app.

It's an exciting place to be: we work with companies you've heard of to do research you'll hear of. Additionally the company really does only pursue business opportunities that it thinks lead to better health outcomes, so I don't have to worry (much) about all our data being used for advertising or worse.  There's a strong culture around privacy, security, and only using data as consented.

As listed on the careers page we have openings on all teams and for all offices, but I'm specifically leading a small team of Rails backend engineers in Santa Barbara who work on "bridge" services that talk to 3rd party APIs, primarily for data ingestion. I'd love to talk to someone with 2+ years of backend experience in or interested in relocating to Santa Barbara. The company in general is very remote friendly and I'd consider adding remote to this team for the right candidate, but more likely at this time a remote Rails engineer would fit in best on one of our other Rails backend teams.
I'm happy to field and route general inquiries about other roles and teams, but again especially looking for a Rails engineer who'd enjoy working on critical data ingestion and related services.    jkimmel  at evidation dot com

Stacker | Europe + Africa Timezones | REMOTE ONLY
.

Stacker lets people build apps without code.

.

We want to change the way software is built and make it available to everyone. That's a pretty big task, and we've got some pretty exciting problems:

If you're a FRONTEND ENGINEER, come and talk to us about how we're building an app runtime that lets you specify an entire app in a bunch of JSON config and have it run as a real-time single page app.

If you're a PRODUCT MANAGER, get in touch and we can chat about how we're taking the features common across all web apps and turning them into installable modules that work seamlessly together.

If you're a PRODUCT DESIGNER, tell us how you'd go about creating not just one design system, but a design-system system to allow our users to build apps that are beautiful by default, but be customisable to the finest level.

If you like PINA COLADA and getting CAUGHT IN THE RAIN, then get in touch anyway.

* * *

We're a fully remote team, Europe+Africa timezones only please. We believe in radical transparency, being good people and making a dent in the universe.
Apply by emailing jobs@stacker.app. Again, Europe+Africa timezones only PLEASE. :)

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance.

Stride | Android Engineer (all levels) | San Francisco, Remote (US-only)
At Stride we're working on a benefits suite for what we believe is an underserved community – freelance and gig economy workers. We want to create economic security for anyone who works for themselves. We offer an easy way for 1099 workers to apply for health/dental/vision coverage. We're also expanding to other spaces like tax, so as to make it financially accessible for anybody who juggles multiple gigs, or is just pursuing a dream on their own.

As a business, we sit on a unique position and have partnerships with a ton of giant companies who want to better serve their workforce. It's rare that a startup has a good mission and a good business, but here we are.

On the engineering side, we use Node, Python, Swift, Postgres, Akka and some cool machine learning models you're going to love hearing about. More particularly on Android, we're moving towards Kotlin at a fast pace (40% of our codebase is Kotlin already, all new code is Kotlin) and we use a state-of-the-art MVI architecture that's great to work on. Your work will be feature-heavy, and you'll have tons of say on its architecture and infrastructure.

We have a beautiful office in SOMA (San Francisco) close to South Park, but we also support and nurture remote workers. We offer fantastic benefits (after all, it's our product!) and you'll be surrounded by the most driven, smartest people I know.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/611/full-stack-software-engineer/

My name is Vinay, and I'm a co-founder and head of engineering at Loom (https://www.loom.com).

We're looking for senior engineers with proven track records of building product under scale of various forms.

Loom is a video platform that allows employees to record and share quick videos. We are on a mission to enhance workplace communication and bring back its humanity. Our company has been on a rapid growth trajectory and the next year will arguably be our greatest year of growth as we're gearing up to release team accounts, our mobile offering, nail down enterprise contracts, and build native recording integrations into very large workplace SaaS tools (cannot disclose details on this point publicly).

We're a small team (30 people) and are remote-first. Half our team is in SF and the other half is distributed across the US, Canada, Brazil and Europe.

All of the roles above are engineers who will be specializing in one product domain and building them from scratch (with devops being the only exception - we have one awesome devops engineer right now so you would be the second).

If you'd like to find out more about our company and culture, peep this! :-)

Unnamed Seed Stage Startup | Founding Engineer OR Founding Design/Product Role | Remote and Bay Area | Full Time
We are a new startup in the UX design tool space, with a mission to radically lower the barriers needed to build full-fidelity prototypes and products—something currently accessible only to a tiny and privileged sub-population (developers).  The stage is very early, pre-product, but we have enthusiastic early feedback.

The team of four has three ex-founders.  We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.

We received strong (outlier) funding offers from a number of top tier VCs.  We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of amazing angels/funds, including leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer.  No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.
If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com.  Thanks, we're excited to hear from you!

We are using Clojurescript (Re-frame based) for the front end, and Clojure on server side. Our mission is to maximize solar energy usage with a frictionless financing process. We have over 1000 installers signed up and have financed 30,000+ installations.  I encourage you to apply if you are motivated to learn Clojure but have never worked full time with it.

Our stack includes a Clojure web app with Clojurescript, Heroku, Postgresql, Github, Box, Docusign, Salesforce. We have a small team so you will have a big impact and get the opportunity to wear a lot of hats. You will be responsible for influencing our tools and processes in addition to delivering features. We are located on California @ Sansome, close to Montgomery BART.

You would join a team of ~10 developers (2 remote) that are split in to 3 teams. Our development process is very collaborative with our product team along with the developers, so communication skills are important. Successful developers are eager to learn the business domain and have a hand in the design and implementation of features, not just programming to a specification.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data.

Lightning Labs is hiring! We’re looking to expand our team to build technology that scales Bitcoin and blockchains. Our current focus is the development and deployment of the Lightning Network, an open blockchain scalability protocol. We push the edge of innovation with regard to blockchain scalability, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX. If you’re interested in one of the positions below, please apply using our careers page: https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/lightningengineering. And if you know someone who might be a good fit, we'd very much appreciate any referrals.

{Crypto Protocol Engineer}:

Experienced systems software engineer versed in applied cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems, open source software, and cryptocurrency protocols to design and implement core protocol and algorithmic components of the Lightning Network. Solid programming skills, experience with Go, C, or C++. Prior contributions to crypto protocols and open source software collaboration preferred.

{Frontend Application Developer}:

Frontend developer to build secure cross-platform second-layer blockchain applications.

{DevOps Engineer}:

Experience with AWS is a bonus, as well as experience with Bitcoin, particularly in the area of key management.
                      
                  
      


Prometheus Research | DevOps Team Lead | New Haven, CT | Full Time | REMOTE | https://prometheusresearch.com/
We are searching for a development operations team leader to continue our transition to the cloud. This is a remote position with eastern timezone working hours, but we need a US Citizen or permanent resident.

Prometheus Research builds and maintains clinical patient registries for health care associations and medical research institutions. Over the past year, we've been updating our solution delivery systems to use Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform and GCP. Our application platform is containerized and uses PostgreSQL, Python, Nginx, and other tools.  Working knowledge about OWASP, OAuth, Linux, VPNs, Firewalls, Logging, Monitoring, and other traditional system administration technologies and skills are essential to this role. We are also in a heavily regulated industry; specific domain knowledge includes: HIPAA, HITECH, FedOnRamp, and others.

This team lead position is a full-time, fully remote position (little travel) with fully remote team members. Thus, it's important to have excellent written communication and know how to use Markdown, diagramming tools, give presentations, and make training videos. We expect about 1d/week of administrative duties, including managing (via O3s) a team of 2-3 system administrators and developers. Your peers will be leading engineering and solution development teams.

Prometheus doesn't have a single SaaS, instead, it has custom solutions for each of our clients. Hence, this position has a different flavor from other roles. We are seeking to transition from a centralized release team to one where each customer solution development team is responsible for their own releases. Our ideal candidate will see themselves as a tool builder, educator, and engineer that is building repeatable processes that client services teams could use.

If this sounds like something you're interested in, please drop me an email, devops-20190903-group@prometheusresearch.com, thanks!
P.S. We are also looking for a senior software engineer. For this, you could see the posting at https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Prometheus-Research/

Magic | Full Remote Job | Full-time | Full-stack | Software Engineering
ABOUT THE COMPANY:

Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.

ABOUT THE POSITION:

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

VP of Engineering | REMOTE (EUROPEAN TIME ZONES) | STARTUP | FULL-TIME
If you have a soft spot for bootstrapped, profitable companies with a meaningful product, and you would like to develop a small, super-capable technical team in a refreshing work environment, you might quite like this extremely rare executive position at Drops.

WHOM WE'RE AFTER:

You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.

You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.

You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.

You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).

You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.

You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture - organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.

We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.

You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.

WHAT'D BE DIFFERENT HERE:

We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.

We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.

We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.

We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit.

We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.

We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.
We automate where it has positive ROI.
Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.
We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.

Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.

REQUIREMENTS

Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.

You have excellent technical and people skills. (yes, we know, it’s rare!)

You are more of a frontend than a backend engineer. (we’re frontend heavy)

You held senior software engineering management position such as CTO, Head of Development, or VP of Engineering positions in the past and enjoyed it.

You have introspective tendencies, and you’re looking for a position where you can grow fast.
You can represent the technology, infrastructure, and the engineering team at the executive level.
                      
                  
      


Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

----- My description -----

(I'm a Sysadmin / DevOps person, I'm not HR or recruitment, but my posting here has been approved by the recruiting dept. I wouldn't post this if I thought this wasn't an actually great company to work for!)

Nexient are good people: My experience at Nexient has been overwhelmingly positive, they are flexible, caring and fun to work at. They actually care about the life/work balance too. Multiple tabletop, D&D, console gaming nights are organized all the time. Charity drives and other ways to give are also promoted within the company. The work environment is really nice too, with motorized standing/sitting desks and laptops that actually have enough memory!! Nexient do outsourcing but with US-based staff, we work closely with clients so we're just part of the team.

Nexient are also working hard to add hundreds of tech jobs in Michigan and Ohio. There's a real need for good folks to help us help our clients.

----- Recruiting Dept's Description -----

Nexient is hiring! In 2009, we launched Nexient to give American businesses a more responsive, domestic alternative to sending software development offshore. We knew we could deliver better software faster by collaborating with clients in real time. Today, we’re the only 100% US tech company among the World’s Top 100 Outsourcers. Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.

We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks. The list of current openings is available at https://www.nexient.com/careers. These are full time positions working from Nexient’s delivery center at Ann Arbor, MI. Visa sponsorship and telecommute / remote work options are not available for these roles.

----- TO APPLY -----

To apply, please use either my email address, aclark@nexient.com OR https://www.nexient.com/careers and mention my email address and name, Anthony Clark.
I could potentially get a bonus if you are hired, just want to fully disclose that I could personally benefit from your actions.
                      
                  
      


Beacon Biosignals | Lead Front-End Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
About us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.

About you:

- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.

- You believe that honesty and frequent, open communication are more signficant contributors to software development than technical wizardy.

- You believe that "looks great" does not necessarily equal "feels great", and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).

- You want to build tools that help people help others in critical environments.

- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between "DRY" as an important guiding principle of software development, and "DRY" as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.

- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.

- You nerd out about content-specific adaptive streaming and compression techniques.

- You think Observable notebooks are really cool.

- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.

- From a front-end perspective, you recognize the tension in the development feedback loop between client-side software and a back-end service ecosystem, and derive immense satisfaction from improving development processes to relieve those tensions.

- You're intimately familiar with the lifecycle of software components - from experiment, to prototype, to an incremental release schedule.

- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.

Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language, and are still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack. Come help us make the right decisions!

Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.
P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!
                      
                  
      


[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because rest is important).
