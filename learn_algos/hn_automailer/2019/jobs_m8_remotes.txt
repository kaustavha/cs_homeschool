Messari | New York, NY (NYC) | Onsite or Remote
We surface actionable info about blockchains via an API (time series, current, and real time via WebSockets) and a React web app. This currently includes market data, on-chain data, and qualitative information (Twitter, Github)... but we want to expand into a lot more (layer 2 networks, non-crypto, and metrics that are a function of other metrics)

example: how long does it take for a new version of a bitcoin client to propagate through the network? (implication: knowing how frequently members of a network update their client software reveals how quickly the network can adapt to new features or security fixes)

Stack: Kubernetes, Postgres, InfluxDB, Golang, Node.js, React/Typescript

Looking for people who are skeptical about crypto, have good OPSEC, and like to learn new things.

For backend people, we care about clean and performant APIs. You can choose to focus on on-chain data, ingestion infrastructure, or jump around across the backend.

For frontend/React people, we care about lightweight JavaScript payloads, fast renders, and minimal CPU usage (great client experience).

At InstaReconstruct (InstaREC), we’re currently working towards the release of our next-generation photogrammetry and scan processing solution. Like our sister company, InstaLOD, we’re enabling enterprise and entertainment companies to create magical 3D experiences in a faster, automated, and scalable way. From military companies building next-generation simulations and data analysis to leading automotive and game developers — our tech plays a vital part in delivering their project.

InstaREC is a newly established startup, that we’ve introduced for the first time at SIGGRAPH 2019 with fantastic reception from all key players in the industry. Everybody is looking forward to getting their hands onto our new tech.
We're not just looking for coworkers but for 
stakeholders and adventurers – driven product owners 
that want to make a difference through their work. 
We’re looking for passionate C++ software developers 
experienced with experience in photogrammetry, point- 
cloud rendering and/or mesh-reconstructions. Ideally, 
you’ve used the Qt framework in past-projects.
Because everything is still being built, we don’t have a career website, so it’s an excellent opportunity to be part of something new and rapidly growing. All parts of our startup are still moving and you’ll be able to drive and influence the direction of our company.
Please provide an up-to-date resume including sample code of previous work that you can share to Michael@theabstract.co.

Kalepa | Software Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.

Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | UTC+4 to UTC+8 | REMOTE
SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses

More than half of our developers are now remote, and I'd like to continue the trend.

To find out more about us, check our technical blog (https://tech.simplepay.cloud) or about page (https://www.simplepay.co.za/about)

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby.

Location: UTC+4 to UTC+8 preferred, although we'll also consider candidates in UTC+1 to UTC+3 if they have the right skills and experience.

CourtAPI.com | Senior Full Stack JS Developer | REMOTE| Market | Full-time | CourtDrive.com & CourtAPI.com
At CourtAPI.com and CourtDrive.com, we are building solutions that enable law firms and other power courthouse website users to become more efficient by automating daily tasks. We’re based in Los Angeles but have a remote team worldwide (Canada, Europe, Armenia to name a few).

We’re looking for a senior full stack JS developer with AWS Amplify, React.js and React Native experience, to help us advance our mission by building new front-end client experiences for web and mobile.

Current Stack: AWS Amplify, React + Redux, Lambda (Node), Postgres, ElasticSearch

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in alot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”

We're a new startup from Boston focused on the $20 Trillion dollar global seaborne trade market.

FreightFlows provides aggregated, predictive analytics for global trade. While maritime data continues to grow in volume and complexity, actionable insights continue to be elusive. The industry instead deals with inaccurate, stale and biased data from many fragmented sources. The complexity of bringing together trusted, timely information means companies have had to rely on dubious, incomplete market insight and therefore make decisions on anecdotal evidence. FreightFlows uses proprietary data science algorithms to synthesize data into trade truth, predictive analytics and actionable intelligence for traders, shippers, owners and brokers.

Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k
https://root.engineering/

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

- Communication, Communication, Communication: We are looking for a developer who understands the importance of team communication. Working remotely requires an added layer of good communication. It's important to keep the team up to date on what you're working on and if you're running into any issues, that you're clearly communicating them to the team so we can work together to figure them out.

- Timelines/Deadlines: Understands the importance of setting and hitting deadlines. Each project you will be expected to set an estimate on how long it will take to accomplish and the work towards hitting that target.

- Detail oriented: Someone who pays attention to detail and cares about the quality of their work, enough so that none of the details slip between the cracks. With each of your commits, it will be important that your notes are accurately reporting what was updated within each of the commits.
If you're interested and feel you would be a good fit, please email me at bj [at] funnelrolodex.com

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers.

You would be working on the core engine and the surrounding components that make up our application.

What we are looking for:

- Strong CS fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, networking)

- Prior experience building software systems (network game, game engine, Web browser, database engine, etc.)

Experience in any of the following is a plus:

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Database design and implementation (query planning, database/storage engines)

- Logic programming / optimization

Language experience:

- C++ is required

- Typescript / Javascript / Lua are plus.

- Any logic/constraint language, such as Prolog, Datalog, SAT / SMT, is a plus

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Lightning Labs | Frontend Developer, Crypto Protocol Engineer, Dev Ops, Infrastructure | San Francisco | Onsite or Remote | Full-time
https://angel.co/lightning/

https://lightning.engineering/

Lightning Labs is hiring! We’re looking to expand our team to build technology that scales Bitcoin and blockchains. Our current focus is the development and deployment of the Lightning Network, an open blockchain scalability protocol. We push the edge of innovation with regard to blockchain scalability, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX. If you’re interested in one of the positions below, please send a brief description of your relevant experience and resume/github to jobs@lightning.engineering. And if you know someone who might be a good fit, we'd very much appreciate any referrals.

{Crypto Protocol Engineer}:

Experienced systems software engineer versed in applied cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems, open source software, and cryptocurrency protocols to design and implement core protocol and algorithmic components of the Lightning Network. Solid programming skills, experience with Go, C, or C++. Prior contributions to crypto protocols and open source software collaboration preferred.

ZeeWise | Atlanta/North GA | Software Developer | https://zeewise.com/ | USA REMOTE | Full-Time
ZeeWise is a very small software company that provides data aggregation and reporting for the franchise sector. We've actually been around for over a decade and have some very well-known customers despite our modest employee count. I'm one of the original tech founders and just took over as CEO. We're beginning the process of overhauling our product/tech stack.

We are looking to hire Software Developer(s) to tweak/update/transform our somewhat legacy platform into a more refined and scalable product.

Our stack is .NET and MSSQL with Angular (moving to Vue) on the frontend, however we're essentially rethinking everything so convince us why we should switch to your favorite stack instead of optimizing what we have.

Our platform has a lot of moving parts and though we are open to junior developers we're too small to be a training grounds/stepping stone position where you'll be compartmentalized to one tiny aspect of the product and playing ping-pong most of the day. We're ideally looking for senior/experienced devs (dare I say "full-stack") that are excited and confident about making systems architecture decisions that will have immediate real-world implications for tens of thousands of small businesses around the world. If you're junior but are confident in your abilities this might be an incredible opportunity and definitely don't be afraid to reach out.

We realize it is a very competitive market out there and are definitely prepared to pay competitive salaries for the right people no matter what level you're at (junior/mid/senior $80k-$150k+) and we're also prepared to negotiate ownership stakes/substantial stock options. As mentioned we're a small team and all have a very healthy work/life balance and a relaxed but productive work ethic.
If you made it this far and are still interested contact us at hackernews@zeewise.com

Mozilla | Operations Engineer | Remote
The team I'm on at Mozilla is preparing to hire more junior/mid and senior engineers in the USA, Canada, and Germany.

We build and maintain the infrastructure that supports Firefox’s many features. This encompasses around 70 services, ranging in scale from 2 users to 20 million concurrent connections, which are created by about a dozen different developer teams. Python is the most common language, though Nodejs, Go, Rust, and even Perl are also represented. When you take a look at the source of these services (most are publicly available in https://github.com/mozilla-services/ and https://github.com/mozilla/), you’ll notice that all are dockerized following the standards at https://github.com/mozilla-services/dockerflow.

Each service run by our team has a primary ops engineer as the main point of contact and a secondary to assist with engineering and on-call responsibilities, so no one person has to be familiar with every technology used in every service. Most services require on-call using pagerduty, but we regard pages as indicators of process problems and invest in the root cause analysis necessary changes to prevent failures from recurring. Although our top priority is keeping everything working well, you’ll often have the flexibility to balance your workload with services aligned with your skills and interests.

We standardize our infrastructure code across projects, so that your work in adding a feature to your own services’ infrastructure can easily be reused by the rest of the team. In our infrastructure Git repos, you’ll design, maintain, improve, and review automation, Python scripts, and monitoring code.
I'm told the postings should go live August 6th at https://careers.mozilla.org/listings/ . If you have any questions, contact me at bpitts+whoshiring@mozilla.com

Tierra (tierra.co) | Software Engineer | San Francisco/Mexico City | Onsite/Remote | Full-time
Imagine having all your day-to-day decisions dictated by a simple question – “Am I putting myself in danger? ” And then not having any real way to answer that question. Countries like Mexico are experiencing an unprecedented wave of crime and violence.

Both the financial and human cost are real:

• 530 billion USD get spent in LATAM on safety and security; 9.4% of Mexico’s GDP

• ~6% of gross revenues for companies is spent on safety/crime prevention

• 8 people go missing per day in Mexico

• 40% of people have changed their habits due to safety concerns

At Tierra, we are working to empower those who are most at risk with the data to make their day-to-day lives safer. We are a team of previously successful entrepreneurs (Twitter, Google, Stripe) based in San Francisco working closely with both governments and corporations in Latin America to pool data and make it actionable.

We work with very large data sets that drive us to constantly improve our technical skills (ever tried to render 1 million data points on a Google map and suggest safe routes?)

We strongly believe (and have begun to prove) that it’s possible to make a real difference by applying technology to a problem that affects hundreds of millions of people on a daily basis. All of us feel a sense of urgency and passion to make the world a little safer.

Want to come join and make a difference? Get in touch: jobs@tierra.co

Full stack engineering position. Our current stack includes Node, Python 3, AWS, Docker, PostgresSQL, PostGIS, GraphQL, React and React Native, Auth0, Jest, Google Maps, various deployment and migration tools, and more. It’s fun, it’s modern, and we’re still forming our business so we’re open to change – which you can help lead. You can help choose approaches in how we store data, access it, what technologies to use, how they should be implemented, how clients behave, and lots more.
Distributed – some of us spend time together in SF/Mexico City on a flexible basis.
Market compensation (both equity and cash). We are well funded.
Female-led. Truly diverse and inclusive team.

Narrative I/O | Scala Backend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | http://narrative.io/
Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.

- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.

- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.

- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.

We are hiring for the backend role and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.

Hack Club (https://hackclub.com) | Director of Club Operations | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE
Launched 3 years ago, Hack Club is a nonprofit global network of student-led hacker clubs across 35 states and 17 countries, impacting thousands of students each year. Our programs span hundreds of after-school clubs, dozens of student-led hackathons, a vibrant online Slack community with thousands of students, and a fiscal sponsorship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship) program that recently crossed $700K in transactions and frontpaged Hacker News a few months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241).

We’re looking to bring in a Director of Club Operations to systematize and grow our primary program: clubs. You will own the end-to-end club experience, including processes to deliver high-quality mentorship to hundreds of club leaders worldwide, enabling Hack Club to scale beyond the number of calls our team can take in a week. If successful, this position will bring Hack Club from 2% of US high schools to becoming as ubiquitous and culturally foundational as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.

This role has C-level freedom, as well as responsibility. You will be tasked with solving the most challenging problems Hack Club faces as a rapidly growing student network. You must be able to work creatively and autonomously to design life-changing student experiences that you can simultaneously maintain and deliver to an ever-growing number of students.

Some examples of challenges to overcome:

- How do we build a diverse and representative community of student leaders and enable leaders to do the same within their clubs?

- How do we offer consistent value to students regardless of their financial background, making the club experience as powerful in Zimbabwe as it is in Cincinnati?

- How do we provide high-quality mentorship and coaching to a large body of student leaders, and bring students into the process of onboarding other clubs?

- How do we ensure that clubs survive the graduation of their leaders?

We need an obsessive, product-minded, operationally-excellent person with past experience growing direct-service programs and an intense focus on the student experience.
Interested? Email me at zach@hackclub.com with a detailed overview of why you think you’d be a good fit for this role.

Adacado | Front End Developers and Back End Engineers | Full Time | Vancouver, BC, Canada | On-site | https://www.adacado.com/new-careers-page-2019/
Adacado is looking for experienced Javascript and Golang programmers to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically.  You’re not just a coder but have a passion for building things and watching them flourish.  You tinker and enjoy creating new methodologies, and never balk at completely abandoning systems and code to undertake complete re-builds. You're not about using the latest and the greatest but the right tools.

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its road map) creates many interesting technical challenges we have yet to solve.  Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, and ES6, and utilizes Node, Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch.  We manage an ever growing army of microservices (200+ unique across 300+ deployments) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise.  You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis.  You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’.  You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill.  You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues.
The Adacado Team
Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit.  We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource (see our link).
We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and  stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget.   All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit.  Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks.  We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.
Location
This is role will be based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be fully elligible to work in Canada. Remote applicants WILL NOT be considered.To apply, send us an email: careers@adacado.com

TalkJS (https://talkjs.com) | Eindhoven (the Netherlands) or REMOTE (European timezones only)
TalkJS lets developers build custom chat features in hours instead of months. We're product driven and we power communication inside online marketplaces, community sites, trading platforms and so on.

JUNIOR PROGRAMMER WHO CAN WRITE

We're looking for someone who's great at writing, pretty good at coding, and wants to get better at the latter. We can give you an opportunity to deeply learn many technologies in a very brief time all while producing useful community content (tutorials, code examples, SDKs, etc) for our (potential) customers.

---

MOBILE DEVELOPER WHO LOVES API DESIGN

TalkJS is currently focused on the web and that's just not good enough. Easy to use APIs and SDKs are the key to our success on the web, and we're looking to do this natively on mobile as well. We could use your help with that.

If you're an experienced developer who's good at coming up with Java and Swift APIs that Android/iOS devs love to use, then get in touch. Apply by emailing to hey@talkjs.com. Bonus points if you can show us an API you designed (on any platform).

---

ONLINE MARKETER

Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing to the point that we have no time left to work on the funnel that drives this demand. This is a luxury problem, which we intend to solve with full force with the help of you, an experienced online marketer with a passion for technical products. We're looking for someone who:


    * Has demonstrable experience growing B2B SaaS inbound 
    * Has sufficient tech skills to set up analytics pipelines 
    * Proactively iterates and experiments 
    * Can write 
    * Wants to jump on a rocket ship that's just taking off² 

Bonus points if you can code a bit. We offer you an opportunity to start, build, and lead our marketing team as we grow. Significant equity is on the table, as well as the chance to work in a great collaborative, open, and constructive distributed team culture.
Apply by sending an email to hey@talkjs.com. Mention something you've helped grow and include something you've written. This can be anything that shows your ability to enthuse: a blog post or a landing page or even a flyer for the local christmas fair.

²) I'm well aware that this is a platitude, but in our case it's really quite true and it wasn't half a year ago. We're blowing up and we need your help :-)

All jobs are remote (Europe) or on-site in Eindhoven, NL. No recruiters or agencies, please.
