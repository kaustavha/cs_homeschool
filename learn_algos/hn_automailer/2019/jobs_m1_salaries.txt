We are an independent startup (non-VC) focused on managing, enriching and presenting large and complex Energy Data.

The CEO’s goal (a CS major) is to prove that being obsessed with aligning software development design with the company’s business strategy is extremely powerful. Our self-funded MVP has been extremely successful.

We are actively looking for someone ready to BUILD and TAKE CHARGE our next generation Data Platform. We are big devotees of Martin Kleppmann's "Building Data-Intensive Applications" book and the Kappa Architecture has become the data backbone of our business.

Our backend Stack:


  - Rust
  - Python
  - Apache Kafka
  - Kubernetes

You will report directly to the CEO and become a core member of our experienced team. Our success and your success will be super aligned as you will be making substantial contributions to our business (data is absolutely critical to us).This is both ONSITE (Downtown Austin, TX) or REMOTE (America and Europe only). Let's talk! Email us at hello@m-u-inc.com

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.

QuotaPath | Backend, Frontend or Full-stack Engineer | Philadelphia, PA or Austin, TX | $70K to $150K DOE | Full-Time | On-Site | https://www.quotapath.com/careers/
Happy new year, y’all!
Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.

We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 9 people: 3 engineers, 1 UX and 4 others. I’m one of those 4 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!

Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.

Cooltrax | Senior Engineers | Melbourne, AUSTRALIA | ONSITE but flexible
Cooltrax builds IoT hardware and software to monitor temperatures, control fridges, and track trailers as they transport goods across the country. That might sound simple, but Australians alone buy $120bn of groceries each year and our services provide an increasingly critical piece of the supply chain infrastructure that makes this possible. We operate in Australia and the United States and have a small engineering team with their home base in Melbourne.

We run a global real-time temperature monitoring system covering some of the largest supply chain partners in the world, where you will face daily challenges and demanding timelines that will be your problems to solve. But we’ll give you the autonomy to choose the right solutions, the flexibility to work in the way that suits you (working from home or abroad is possible, some of the time), and the support to handle everything a rapid-paced start-up environment can throw at you. Most of our front-end and back-end software is in JavaScript (or increasingly TypeScript), we’re moving from an Ember.js application to React, our firmware is in C/C++, and our infrastructure is defined in code and orchestrated with Kubernetes. Other technology keywords we use include: MySQL, CouchDB, GraphQL, Redis, node.js, Azure, git, and Jira.
For a more thorough position description, or just to have a chat about the sorts of projects we have here, please contact me at: tom.allen@cooltrax.com. I'm the Engineering Manager here and I'm passionate about building a workplace culture that supports high performance engineering. We have our fair share of problems and legacy software to deal with, but there's abundant opportunity for interesting greenfields work too, with a board ready and willing to invest in new areas of the business.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. 9 Months ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+2 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly. (P.S. I'm on holiday, so it will be at least a week before I reply)

Hey fellow engineers and future colleagues,

We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services.

It's also pretty awesome that goal-oriented conversations are like conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our decision making so there is a lot of impactful work to do.

We are starting to share our API with other companies and need to create a great developer experience for them. This new role will get to own the open source SDK and client libraries, CLIs, documentation, key management etc. Same goes for logging, BI, and infrastructure for the developer ecosystem.

Our main tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. We prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles over cleverness and magic.

We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy. No jerks allowed, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!

There is a small take-home project that covers basic data transformation and schema design. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding exercises. Open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.

We will have an interview to go over implementation choices, ideas, and discuss technology. Then we do a couple with other team members to cover general topics like management philosophy, industry and market perspectives, intellectual motivations, professional development trajectory, office environment, interpersonal style etc.
Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!

$5 == Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | Full-time | https://www.thanx.com/careers/job/1466586/Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing with the same message to everyone. The result is an ever-increasing wave of generic spam that makes it hard for consumers to build deeper, data-driven relationships with their favorite brands. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.

Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineers; Product Managers; Data Scientists | San Francisco, CA | Onsite
The mission of Academia.edu is to accelerate the world’s research. To accelerate the pace of discovery. Academia.edu is building a new communications system for the dissemination and peer review of academic research.

We believe that there are some inefficiencies in academic publishing today. We believe that by shifting to an internet-first dissemination system, academic publishing can be made faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

Over 20 million papers have been uploaded to Academia.edu, out of 100 million papers ever written. About 40 million people visit Academia.edu each month to access academic research. Academia.edu became profitable in 2017 off of a premium business model.

Here are some of the priorities at Academia.edu:

- Open access: we want every paper ever written to be on the internet, available for free

- Distribution system: for any given upload, it could be distributed to any one of Academia.edu's 72 million registered users. The goal of the distribution system is to enable a paper be distributed to the right subset of people. We want that subset to see that paper in their News Feed and think “Wow, I really want to read that.”

- Multi-platform: we started out on Web, and we are in the process of releasing an iOS app. After the iOS app, we will release an Android app.

- Peer review: as papers are distributed through the Academia.edu graph, academics share their opinions about those papers, and those opinions aggregate over time.

We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."

We are looking to hire full stack software engineers, iOS engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.
If you are interested to learn more, please email the CEO, Richard Price, at richard [at] academia.edu

When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

RaiseMe is expanding access to higher education by reinventing how students earn scholarship dollars from colleges. Our platform allows colleges and universities to award incremental "micro-scholarships" to high school and community college students, based on academic, testing, extracurricular, and real-world experience. We've over 250 college partners, and users in 1 of 2 high schools in the US. Many of our students earn tens-of-thousands of dollars for college. The coolest part of our platform is how it educates students about the possibility of college in the first place. Many of our users are first-generation college attendees, or minority or low-income students.

We closed our Series B in 2018, bringing our total funding to around $30M. Our investors include Salesforce Ventures, Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, The Emerson Collective, Teamworthy Ventures, and First Round, among others.

Synthetic Minds (YC S18) | SF + Seattle | $120k+ | First 5 engineers: commensurate equity | ONSITE, Full Time
The ideal candidate has a master/phd in systems, compilers, programming languages, or distributed systems; but never gets to use it in their day job. Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.

Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads/writes smart contracts in Ethereum's Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer's code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can even “synthesize” it.

In Oct 2018, we raised a $5.6M seed round from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [6]. We have paying customers and a backlog waiting to be on-boarded. The team is heavily experienced.  This is the founder’s second startup and they have a PhD in the area. The 1st employee was the first hire at Parse (YC S11) and has 10 yrs at Google. We aim to be a 10-15 person all-engineering team in 2019.
Roles/Openings (see [1]):
# Software engineer: Systems/infrastructure — You’ll be working on distributing heavy CPU processes on AWS. Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node/process/memory/algorithm failures.
# Software engineer: Compilers/verification/synthesis — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover [3]. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.

# Software engineer: Smart contracts — You’ll be working on the “front-end of the compiler”, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis). Desire to work at the compiler level of smart contracts is required, e.g., see [4] — experience in writing smart contracts is easily acquired as a side effect.
