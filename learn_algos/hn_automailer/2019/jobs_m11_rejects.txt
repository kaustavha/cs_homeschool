Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only, select roles only)| $80k-$170k https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.
We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Intel (Quartus FPGA compiler) | Toronto, ON, Canada
Interested in working on algorithmically-complex C++ code to squeeze out every last bit of performance? Actually using advanced computer science knowledge outside of interviews and programming competitions? Optimizing graph-based algorithms simultaneously for runtime, memory, and quality of the resulting solution? Understanding the hardware as well as the software? Then working on Quartus, Intel's compiler for FPGAs, is for you.

You will work in a downtown Toronto location, with an amazing and diverse group of talented engineers, on some of the most intellectually challenging problems in the world, and your work will directly benefit areas like AI, telecommunications, healthcare, aerospace, finance and more.

I am looking to hire specifically for the Timing Analysis team, which is responsible for one of the most critical components in the Quartus compilation flow (all compilation decisions are ultimately aimed at making the resulting FPGA design faster, and to determine the impact of various decisions on speed you need a robust and efficient timing engine). My colleagues are hiring for other roles. Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents preferred.

Instrumental | ONSITE | Palo Alto, CA, USA; Chicago, IL, USA; Charlotte, NC, USA; Longhua, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China
Can you imagine writing software with no debugger or logging, and you only get to run it every few weeks? That's what building hardware is like for many product companies. At Instrumental, we're building a manufacturing optimization system that collects data no one else can, and uses machine learning and visualizations to automatically identify defects and help product companies understand their assembly processes.

With ~30 people we are a small but mighty team with a collaborative, friendly culture. We value an inclusive environment and actively work to promote diversity in our team.

We also value good tools. For example, I manage the web app team - our deploys involve running a single command and take just a few minutes, so we deploy frequently and with confidence. "Watch mode" compilation usually takes under a second. We have "branch environments" to test any pull request in a production-like environment with real data. And we have robust tests.
We're hiring for basically every engineering role: backend, frontend, systems, SRE... apply online: https://www.instrumental.com/careers

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end.

oso | Software Engineer | New York City (NYC) - Onsite | https://www.osohq.com/
oso (backed by Sequoia) makes backend infrastructure security not terrible for developers and ops. We provide a normalized and consistent interface to core security controls, like authentication and encryption, and we do so in a way that’s invisible to developers and simple for ops. We are hiring small number of sharp engineers who want to get involved on the ground floor and who have some combination of experience in and appetite for taking on these kinds of problems:
1. Building an elegant experience for a highly technical end-user, e.g., making it easy and intuitive for an ops engineer to get up and running in <5 mins
2. Low-level distributed systems, e.g., building lightweight proxies that manage requests asynchronously and deal with things like caching and network failures
3. Running an on-path production service, e.g., building a scalable and resilient service layer across multiple regions and cloud providers
We are building the product in Rust, which we think is both a good design choice for our use case and a fun choice for the team. By virtue of our stage, the engineers who join now will not only have a disproportionately large impact on the product, but also on the culture and future of the company. Given the importance of these team members and magnitude of their contribution, they will get a meaningful equity position.

Founding team: Graham Neray (early employee and Chief of Staff at MongoDB) and Sam Scott (PhD in Cryptography).

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Leads | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa are solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa's team members have worked at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Secfi | Software engineer(s) + Operations and Finance | Amsterdam, the Netherlands + San Francisco | EUR 50-150k + equity

We do this by providing shareholders of private companies with liquidity so that they can exercise their options or access capital for personal use.

By simplifying their equity compensation, employees can spend more time on things they love doing most. We have offices in Amsterdam and San Francisco.

Fern Creek Software | Louisville KY | Multiple Positions | Remote
Fern Creek is a software consulting company. We build stuff for other people, usually in .NET on Azure but we do other stuff occasionally. The company has been around since I started consulting independently about 20 years ago. Recently I started taking on larger projects that need more people and as a result, started hiring people. Sometimes a 1099, sometimes W2.

This is not super sexy stuff where you will get options that might be worth millions, but likely worth nothing. What you will get is a load of experience on new tech (asp.net core, azure, blazor etc) and a great focus on the best feature of all...shipping.

The job is remote so you don't have to be in Louisville though if you are close that is cool. Set your own hours and all that, I want pros not people that need babysitting.

3 openings right now...
Full stack dev (C#, asp.net core, sql server etc)
UX Guru (more than a photoshop jockey, make the html and css for us so we dont have to)
QA engineer (test all the things, write unit tests, automated UI tests)
Live the stress free life, work from home, build some cool tech, make money, be happy etc etc.

At InstaReconstruct (InstaREC), we’re currently working towards the release of our next-generation photogrammetry and scan processing solution. Like our sister company, InstaLOD, we’re enabling enterprise and entertainment companies to create magical 3D experiences in a faster, automated, and scalable way. From military companies building next-generation simulations and data analysis to leading automotive and game developers — our tech plays a vital part in delivering their project.

InstaREC is a newly established startup, that we’ve introduced for the first time at SIGGRAPH 2019 with fantastic reception from all key players in the industry. Everybody is looking forward to getting their hands onto our new tech.

We're not just looking for coworkers but for stakeholders and adventurers – driven product owners that want to make a difference through their work. We’re looking for passionate C++ software developers with experience in GPGPU programming frameworks and technologies, such as OpenCL and CUDA, GPU based optimizations techniques, and modern 3D frameworks. Ideally, you've used the Qt-framework in past projects.

Because everything is still being built, we don’t have a career website, so it’s an excellent opportunity to be part of something new and rapidly growing. All parts of our startup are still moving and you’ll be able to drive and influence the direction of our company.
Please provide an up-to-date resume including sample code of previous work that you can share to Michael@theabstract.co.

Glow | Lead Software Engineer | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | glow.fm
Glow's mission is to create a world where content realizes its value, starting with helping podcasters build media businesses. Today, we're the easiest and most flexible way for podcasters to build membership programs. Over time, we aim to be for podcasters what Shopify is for e-commerce entrepreneurs. We are 100% aligned with creators and aim to help them succeed by creating a business around what they love to do.

We are looking for a Lead Software Engineer to be one of the early members of our team. This is an opportunity to help build Glow from its earliest days. The role is mostly individual contributor work (technical vision, design, writing code), with some time mentoring 2-3 other engineers on the team.

We promise that you'll never be bored, that you'll be trusted to manage your own time, and that you'll be working on something that makes a difference in the lives of content creators and their fans. Also, we offer a competitive salary, full medical/dental benefits, and unlimited podcasts.

Does the following sound like you? You love podcasts. You are excited about helping creators thrive and build a living around their content. You have strong customer empathy and a track record of building customer-facing products. You work iteratively, shipping often and measuring results. You enjoy a small team where bureaucracy is low but great communication and collaboration is essential. You don’t get hung up on the boundaries of front-end, back-end, dev ops – you do whatever it takes to deliver. You think in terms of architecture and love to stitch together all elements of the software lifecycle to deliver great software. You thrive in the ambiguity and activity of a startup environment.

We closed our $2.3M seed round of financing in August with a great group of investors including Greycroft, Jeff Katzenberg's WndrCo, and the rapper Nas.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

These are the roles that my team is currently focused on hiring: Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer - Distributed Systems, Software Quality Engineer, Software Quality Engineer - Performance

Our company is 100% remote and proud of it. You can work anywhere in the US or Europe, but we require an overlap of 8am-noon Pacific working hours.

Our technology stack is largely Java and Kotlin on the backend and TypeScript, AngularJS, and React on the frontend. The core of our product is a full-featured calculation engine that can perform complex math and execute machine learning algorithms on streaming time series data.

I am not the hiring manager, but am involved with the interview process, and happy to answer any questions. Feel free to contact me at stephen.rosenthal@seeq.com, but please do not email applications or resumes to me.

Eleos Technologies | Remote (US only) | Full time
Eleos Technologies is a growing 8-year-old company building communication software for truck drivers and field workers.

We’re helping a diverse mix of customers—from mom and pop operations to household names—improve how they communicate with their employees by tackling information overload, reducing phone calls, and eliminating obsolete technologies.

We're looking to grow our mobile team, which maintains our native iOS and Android apps. These apps are used by thousands of big-rig and small truck drivers, day and night, every day. We've got two mobile engineers who have experience with both platforms, and we're looking to keep that flexibility and mindset as we grow.

The apps do some unique things, including assisting drivers to plan their trips, find stopovers, manage their electronic duty log, and more—there's a lot more than just CRUD and chat features to go around.

As a remote team, we're super lucky to have some great folks who use the ability to work from home to spend more time with their kids, help volunteer at a school, or otherwise be more fulfilled than they would be working from an office. You could join us!
If that sounds fun and rewarding to you, the full description and info about applying are over here: https://jobs.lever.co/eleostech/e09301bb-0e4e-4ccd-8d5f-e185f7ebd541

Moonfish (https://moonfish.com) | San Francisco, CA | Full-time, Onsite Preferred, but Open to Remote
Moonfish is a big data for consumer travel company, aiming to help people plan and book travel more easily and cheaply (starting with flights). While other travel products start by asking departure/return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).

We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA/Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.

About Survata

Survata is a YC/venture-funded startup building the Brand Intelligence Platform.

We're a busy team, thanks to the increasing success of our product: the Conjur appliance secures the entire software development and deployment lifecycle for companies who want to ship features as fast as possible without increasing their risk of security breaches.

* Golang, Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and JS

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React & React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend and mobile, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

If you're a MULTI-SKILLED PRODUCT DESIGNER (UI+UX+Product), come and help us design a modular product that empowers non-developers to build the software they need.

You'll be creating a flexible design system that we can be customized by the user and still look great.

You'll be taking common web features like news feed and messaging, and stripping them down to their most pure form so they work in any app.

You'll be designing a set of modules that let non-technical users feel empowered and able to create amazing, innovative apps.

We're recently funded, and are a fully remote team, but we get together every few months.

We believe in Radical Transparency, being Empathetic and Kind and Making a Dent in the Universe.

We're hiring backend Python and Java developers, frontend Angular developers, QA engineers, data scientists, data engineers, product managers, engineering managers and more. Job openings can be filled in Santa Clara or Charlotte, NC.

https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/leantaascom

Everyone complains that our healthcare system is inefficient and costly. If the idea of working with smart people to actually solve the problem and make it significantly better for our future generations seems worth your time, reach out to me directly at hireme@leantaas.com and I'll put you in touch with the right hiring manager.

We're a Series C funded healthcare tech company based in Silicon Valley obsessed about making our hospitals more efficient with data science and machine learning. 65+ healthcare organizations including the likes of Stanford, Duke, NYP, Dignity, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Tenet and more rely on our products to lower patient wait times, improve staff satisfaction and overall financial performance.

Our team includes successful entrepreneurs, engineers, product managers and data scientists from Google, LinkedIn, Apple, Symantec MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Google, McKinsey, and more.

Our vision is to build an "Air Traffic Control" for hospitals - a centralized command and control center that routes the right information to the right department as patients flow through the system - if we get that right, we'll be able to significantly make our hospitals more efficient and eliminate waiting and wastage and solve the problem once and for all.

Scribd | Software Engineers | San Francisco, Toronto, Amsterdam | ONSITE or REMOTE | VISA
Scribd is a reading subscription that gives you access to the best books, audiobooks, magazines, and more. Our mission is to change how the world reads. At the beginning of the year we hit 1M paying subscribers (https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/scribd-1-million-subscribers/)! We are one of the oldest YC startups (YC ’06), operating one of the largest Ruby on Rails sites.

Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture with competitive salary and great benefits. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance. In general we care way more about your personality, communication, and hacking skills than what languages and technologies you’ve used so far.

We are hiring software engineers across the board (see https://www.scribd.com/careers), including:

* The Content Engineering team is in need of both software engineers and senior software engineers, onsite in our new San Francisco office, onsite in our Toronto office, or remote within the United States. The Content Engineering team was newly formed with the dual mission to own and update Scribd's existing content metadata pipeline and build new metadata that can be used by the search, recommendations, data science, and frontend teams to build more useful and intelligent features. The work includes building data pipelines, data engineering, and a touch of machine learning.

* The Search team is constantly striving to improve Search at Scribd in various dimensions - Quality, Relevance, Speed, Costs, Real-time indexing, Uptime, etc. We are looking for software engineers with experience working with Search systems. Experience with Elastic Search is a strong plus. (More details at https://jobs.lever.co/scribd/0de0db4b-971a-4d1d-ac90-9681f97583bd)

We have hired many people from these HN threads, including myself (back in 2012!). If you have specific questions you can reach out to me directly at adrian at scribd.com (I'm the Head of Technology and happy to answer questions related to our roles - recruiters/agencies: please do not contact me).

Aquabyte | San Francisco, CA | Full Time | Edge (Systems) Engineer, Chief of Staff to CEO | ONSITE, VISA https://jobs.lever.co/aquabyte/
Aquabyte (https://www.aquabyte.ai, backed by NEA and Costanoa, top tier investors) is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.

Watch our TV episode with Amazon CTO Werner Vogels here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ_qJ5JFD3I

Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.

Beacon Biosignals | Lead Operations Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
Our super early-stage startup is seeking an individual to lead the development/operations of our AWS infrastructure, and along the way teach us all how to deliver more robust software.

About Us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a semi-stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks.

About You:

- You're excited to design a service architecture that orthogonalizes the critical feedback loops that entangle our code, data, models, and products.

- You're tired of organizations treating DevOps like an individual role instead of a company-wide practice.

- You're a networks/containers nerd who will turn us into networks/containers nerds.

- You've witnessed the pains that result from fitting square AWS-provided-solution pegs into round in-house-problem holes. Conversely, you've also seen how NIH syndrome can drive teams down a rabbit hole whose endpoint is a shallow reproduction of an existing AWS solution that could've just been employed in the first place.

- You are familiar with the many idiosyncrasies of storing, streaming, and analyzing large volumes of dense signal data in the cloud (e.g. audio, video, domain-specific sensor data, etc.).

- You believe that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture, and that lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. This quarter, we're tackling model evaluation as a CI process, pushing >70TB of signal data (and our processes for manipulating it) into AWS, and developing a browser-based viewing/analysis application for our signal data. Come help us make the right decisions!
Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.

Labelbox | San Francisco, CA or Remote (Global) | Onsite | Remote OK | https://labelbox.com

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE | Full-time, ONSITE & REMOTE
Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune ranked us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5] [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, parental leave, fertility/adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 2-3 times a year, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.dauber@[company site].

FlightAware | Senior Data Scientist / Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Houston, TX | Full-time, ONSITE, https://flightaware.com, https://flightaware.com/commercial/foresight/
FlightAware is expanding its world-class team that builds the predictive technology behind the FlightAware Foresight product suite. FlightAware Foresight is already used by some of the largest airports and airlines in the world to improve operational efficiencies on the ground and in the air. As a senior data scientist at FlightAware, you will work alongside talented developers, systems engineers, and analysts to design, evaluate and improve state-of-the-art machine learning models underlying both current and future Foresight products.

You would bring scientific rigor and statistical methods into a multi-disciplinary engineering group pushing the industry forward and tackling some of the hardest problems in this space. We train thousands of models on hundreds of thousands of CPU cores using datasets with hundreds of millions of examples, and we stream real-time flight data from around the world through these models running on multiple clusters in order to produce thousands of inferences per second. These models compute estimated runway landing and gate arrival times for commercial and GA flights around the world. FlightAware in general processes over 180 million incoming messages per hour from over 22,000 individual data feeds. You would bring a broad technical and engineering background with you, allowing you to design solutions that can scale and operate in this demanding environment.

We're looking for someone with a solid real-world track record of delivering complex machine learning systems in production that solve well-defined business problems. This is decidedly a senior-level role, although less experienced but truly exceptional candidates will be considered. We have no formal requirements about educational background; while a PhD is probably a plus, it's not required, and we're more impressed by real-world results. You need a nontrivial expertise in statistics, machine learning, statistical learning, and deep learning that goes beyond what a talented engineer might learn studying in the evenings for fun. You also need a solid engineering foundation; you wouldn't be isolated from infrastructure and systems engineers but would be working with and alongside them.
FA is a small company (currently ~100 employees), but we're not a startup. We've been around for over a decade and don't rely on VC funding. Our Foresight team alone produces millions of dollars of revenue. The company is successful, profitable, and growing. And we just built out a brand new modern office space in Houston. To apply, please send me an email using the email in my profile here.

Stateless | Boulder, CO | Onsite | stateless.net
At Stateless we are building something special. Not just in terms of a disruptive technology but also in terms of culture. A culture were people authentically personify our organizational values. Supportive. Sincere. Studious. Striving. Stateless.

Stateless is on a mission to reinvent network connectivity. Central to that was our initial innovation, where we demonstrated an ability to efficiently decouple state from processing in network functions—a task deemed infeasible in high-performance networking systems, but in doing so, we have opened the door for fundamentally changing how networks are built. Now, we are building the product around that vision. VCs have backed us, and early adopters have validated the business opportunity.

We are hiring for a variety of roles: from C++ Python and Kotlin developers to sales and support engineers.

WHAT IS INTERCOM? 
Intercom is the world’s #1 business messenger and more.
Whether our customers want to do more with less by leaning on our 100+ apps, we help out  customers’ customers self serve with articles and chat bots, or target chat to specific segments Intercom is customer messaging that fits their business. Intercom is also the best team inbox for sales and support AND the leading choice for targeted outbound messages that deliver. Valued at over $1bn, Intercom has been ranked among the best on the Crunchbase unicorn leaderboard since 2018. In our 8 year history, we’ve built world class sales, marketing and R&D functions, and published a number of books along the way (https://www.intercom.com/books).
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK FOR INTERCOM?
Our culture is open and friendly and inclusive - and this is something we are proud of. We are optimistic, passionate and positive. We like people who can stay focused and work hard and who are confident, yet kind and humble. We like to experiment, sometimes inventing things for the first time, but we stay pragmatic, starting small and simple in everything we do. We love people who genuinely want to learn and grow and take bets on high potential engineers on rapid trajectories.
We’re opinionated by default, for example we run LESS software (https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/) and ship continuously (https://www.intercom.com/blog/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/). We’re technically conservative and like to keep it simple (https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/build-boring-software/), but where it means building better products we’ll double down on new technology like machine learning (https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-fergal-reid-ai-machine-learning/) in a pragmatic way.

TECH: Ruby on Rails application with an Ember.js frontend. We use MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon’s DynamoDB for most of our storage. Our web messenger is built on React.

We would encourage you to apply, even if you don't believe you meet every one of our qualifications described.

Tray.io | London | Engineer Manager / Backend Engineer (Scala) / Product Manager / Program Manager | Full-time | Onsite | https://tray.io
Tray is a visual programming tool for APIs. It’s a low-code user experience that allows anyone* to precisely instrument the data flow between their SaaS tools. *No dev resources required.
