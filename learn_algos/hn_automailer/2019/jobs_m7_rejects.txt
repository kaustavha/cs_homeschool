O(1) Labs | San Francisco, CA | Product / Front-end Engineer | Full Time | Onsite | https://codaprotocol.com
At O(1) Labs, we're building the Coda Protocol, the first cryptocurrency to have a constant-sized blockchain. We use recursive zk-SNARKs to compress historic state in Coda's blockchain so that nodes don't have to store all the data going back to the first transaction. Compare this to Bitcoin or Ethereum whose blockchains already have hundreds of GBs of data, and keep growing.

We're excited about this tech because it allows all the nodes in a network to be full nodes (no SPV's!) and enables applications that can use the entire blockchain embedded in a phone or a browser.

I'm on the product team, and we're looking for product engineers - but you can find all the roles we're hiring for here - https://codaprotocol.com/jobs.html. Our stack is OCaml on the protocol side, and ReasonML + React on the front-end. All of our code is open source - https://github.com/codaprotocol/coda.
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to meet in person for a coffee, if you're based in the bay area. My email is pranay@o1labs.org.

P# team at Microsoft | Redmond, WA | Contract | Onsite
The P# team at Microsoft works on enabling developers to write reliable, well-designed and well-tested software through model checking and language integration techniques. The approach is reminiscent of TLA+ like techniques but differs in that the code _is_ the model and developers don't have to write models separate from the implementation. P# explores interesting paths through the state space a program can take and produces reproducible traces which can be used to debug and fix issues in services and distributed systems.
This position will involve a variety of tasks including writing samples and documentation to help P# gain wider adoption, and porting parts of the testing infrastructure to work on .NET core. It will also involve working on novel visualization techniques to aid debugging and comprehension of services and distributed systems.

Voltus | Backend/Frontend/Full Stack | NY/Remote | Full-Time
We are a team of engineers and energy experts working to get our customers paid for using less energy. We work with large energy consumers to identify demand response and distributed energy resources. We aggregate those resources into virtual power plants that we sell to utilities and other buyers in wholesale energy markets, splitting the revenue with our customers. Our virtual power plants are cleaner and cheaper than the coal and oil plants they replace. Along the way we have to solve the hard system reliability problem of making hundreds of commercial and industrial sites behave like a single, reliable power producer.

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and increasingly Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA

FullStory | Software Engineering, Mobile Frameworks | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA

FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web and mobile devices. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture. If things like Rust, app and framework disassembly, or reverse engineering sound like fun, we’d love to talk to talk.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!
Please submit via our jobs page: https://www.fullstory.com/jobs/

Discord | Security Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime | ~$150k - $250k base + equity + hoodies (equity/hoodie split subject to negotiation)
Hello friends! We're hiring engineers for our brand new security engineering team. Check out the description here: https://discordapp.com/jobs/4362278002

Historically, Discord hasn't had a dedicated security team -- we just happen to have a small handful of engineers with a strong enough security background to pick up this kind of work in their spare time. We've since grown to the point where we finally have enough work to justify a full time security engineering team. Note that this team isn't just infrastructure security (although it certainly includes that) -- we'll also be building product features, new backend services, internal tooling, and more. If you have a solid grasp on software development, an extensive security background, and are excited about helping build a security team from the ground up, please get in touch!

Of course, if you're interested in working at Discord but not in this particular role, we have plenty of other openings at https://discordapp.com/jobs (but I'm not the hiring manager for those).
If you have any questions (about the role, Discord, resume advice, or whatever you feel like), feel free to add me on Discord at cmFtc2V5IzAwMDE=. Do note that I probably won't respond if it's a weekend (and your DM might get buried under the avalanche of work-related DMs by Monday). Last time I did this someone messaged me three Saturdays in a row and then angrily blocked me because I wasn't responding. If you're reading this: I'm sorry! Just message me on a weekday! :)

Joyent | Software Engineer | Remote, San Francisco, Vancouver, BC | https://www.joyent.com/about/careers/software-engineer-triton-object-storage-sf
The Product

The Triton Object Store, informally referred to as “Manta”, is a large-scale open-source object storage platform that is run across multiple geographical regions worldwide as a cloud service. Unlike other object storage products, it has strong consistency guarantees, it uses a Unix-like file system hierarchy for organizing objects, it supports containerized compute jobs on the storage nodes, and it supports multiple object links. Manta is run both as a public and private cloud service and on premises in many data centers. Architecturally, it is a large-scale distributed system composed of multiple microservices implemented in node.js and C with metadata state stored in PostgreSQL clusters. Additionally, we are exploring emerging languages and platforms for new development; e.g., Rust.

Candidates
We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code—software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.

Picnic | React Native Developer | London | Onsite | Full time or contract
We're a tiny, but well-backed, team trying to build an alternative to the ad-funded social media platforms of today, by prioritising face-to-face time over screen time. Between us we've previously founded consumer tech businesses, led product teams, run a micro-VC and even launched a (secret) music career.

We are looking for React & React Native developers who love creating products that people want to use. You understand that apps—and code—are for people, not for computers, and always strive to make our app and codebase more understandable and easy to use.

You'll be helping to build an app using the latest best practices targeting the web, iOS and Android. We're using TypeScript across the stack, React with hooks client-side, an event-sourced architecture using PostgreSQL and Redis server-side, and GraphQL for type-safe communication between the two.

We've taken care to make our hiring process as transparent and stress-free as possible. We won't do any whiteboard / algorithm interviews, and you'll be paid for any take-home test we ask you to complete. We aim to give honest feedback after any interview, so that the process is not a waste of time for you even if the role is not a fit for you for whatever reason.

Earnin (https://www.earnin.com/) | Sr. Fullstack Engineer | Cloud DevOps Engineer | iOS Engineer | Android Engineer | ONSITE | Palo Alto, CA
Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don’t accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we’re working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people’s needs.

You can help make a difference. Message me for more details at jeremy.wyatt@earnin.com

Hazel Analytics | Data Scientist | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $150K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics is a fast-growing food tech company on a mission to create innovative products that change the way organizations use food safety data. Founded in 2014 by professors from Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Maryland, we're the proven market leader in health department data analytics, serving Amazon, Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, Whole Foods, and more — nearly half of the largest 100 food retail chains. Our platform transforms diffuse and disparate local health department data into actionable operational intelligence for our customers, who need to proactively monitor food safety and regulatory compliance while serving millions of meals every day. In recognition of our impact, we're a proud recipient of the Food Marketing Institute's Food Safety Innovation Award (2019) and Jack in the Box's Food Safety Innovation Award (2016).

We're currently seeking a data scientist who will help identify new opportunities and develop high-impact data analytics, predictive models, and statistical tools for our user community. You'll be expected to be both a creative and critical thinker, to have strong judgment in prioritization and execution, and to strike a balance between moving quickly and delivering high-trust analytics. You'll need to not only think and act like a leader but also roll up your sleeves and deliver production-ready models. Our tech stack predominantly features Python and R, but your input will be instrumental in further defining our architecture.

We're profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution. Personally, I was hired from a HN job thread — I'm looking forward to seeing some great HN applicants!

Sundae | Software Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Growth Marketers| San Francisco | Onsite | https://sundae.com/
Sundae’s mission is to help homeowners get the best outcome when it’s time to sell a house that needs some love. For too long, the process for selling outdated and damaged houses has been terrible for sellers. Local property investors capitalize on homeowner distress to purchase houses cheap and resell them for huge profits.

Sundae is putting more of those profits back in the hands of the homeowner. We’ve developed a model to predict when sellers will need our help, and a best-in-class sales and marketing team to reach them and a trusted brand that allows us to grow even faster through word of mouth and referrals. With scale and efficiency we’re able to redistribute economic value to sellers in the form of the most competitive price so that Sundae can become the largest buyer of homes that need love in the United States.

We're hiring across all roles and are looking for people who are mission-driven, ambitious, and want to join a hypergrowth company.
Apply here https://sundae.com/careers/ or message glenn@sundae.com if you want to hear more/have any questions.

[TBD - negotiating domain] | Designer who can code (node/python preferred)| LONDON, UK | Onsite, full time | http://linkedin.com/in/Ray5D
Hi, I’m Ray.

I founded Unmortgage, the new way to buy a home without a mortgage.

After securing a partnership with Allianz for an initial fund of £500m and also the largest seed round in Europe (probably ever) of £10m, I’ve stepped down as CEO to work on something new.

I have designed a new business that adds such value to people’s lives that they trust us for buying essential financial services: mortgages, insurance, high-Speed broadband.

I’m looking for someone to work side-by-side with me.

The goal is to be up-and-running within a few months and generating several million pounds worth of profit by this time next year.

I have several potential venture and private equity backers to help us grow, but I’m keen to get as far as we can bootstrapped.

There is additionally an opportunity to roll-up 7 existing businesses which generate over £1bn in revenue today. They would cost c.£200m to acquire. Hence lining up private equity.

Just to provide a flavour of my ambition.
Happy to chat and answer any questions - I tend to be an open book, as I find that is the best way to learn and build trust: rayhan@rafiqomar.com

National Journal (Atlantic Media) | Senior Web Developer | Washington, DC | Onsite | https://nationaljournal.com
Tech Stack: We spend most of our time in Python/Django and Javascript. Our frontend is mostly jQuery but we're changing that now (we do a bit with both React and Vue). Other things we work with daily/semi-daily include Postgres, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Neo4j, Pandas, and Less.

Company Description: National Journal serves government affairs professionals with the in­tel­li­gence and tools they need to save time, in­crease ef­fi­ciency, and de­liv­er suc­cess. With a focus on actionable research, insights, and custom content, National Journal keeps members informed about key movements in people, politics, and policy.

We're a small team with good people, solid work-life balance, and interesting problems to solve. A lot of the job involves building new functionality around vendor integrations (Salesforce, Marketo, Google Analytics) and ingesting third-party data (FEC, Wikidata, VoteSmart, KnowWho...), as well as building out custom pages and dashboards for the public-facing site and for our home-grown CMS.

Secfi | Software engineer(s) | Amsterdam, the Netherlands | EUR 40-80k + equity
Secfi is the pre-wealth advisor for startup employees. Figuring out what to do with your equity-based compensation is complicated and expensive and is therefore ignored and neglected. Secfi makes handling startup equity compensation simple and affordable. We build technology that helps employees make the right decisions for their equity compensation.

For example: one of the most complicated things for employees is figuring out how much taxes they need to pay when exercising their Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options. The tax planning tool inside our dashboard does just that: https://www.secfi.com/#gif-container

An exciting challenge we’re working on next is an exercise planning tool that tells you what you should do with your equity based on your personal.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/

State Auto | Tech Lead | Columbus, Ohio | ONSITE | Full-Time | https://stateauto.com
We're a 100-year-old insurance company that's in the process of re-inventing itself as a tech company that happens to sell insurance.[0] Our team is at the front of this transformation: we develop proofs of concept and prototypes to evaluate technologies and techniques that can make State Auto better and faster, and at a lower cost, in support of our internal and external customers. The sort of core mantra for our group is to fail fast and fail forward: we recognize that a lot of what we do will not be a fit for the company and might never progress beyond the PoC stage. That makes throughput really critical for us: our typical PoC concludes within about 4—6 weeks.[1] Sometimes this is an evaluation of a vendored product, most times it's building out our own in-house solution from FOSS components.

Current stack: Python, React, AWS, Linux, Docker/Kubernetes, TensorFlow

What we offer: competitive compensation; full medical/dental/vision; 401(k); unlimited PTO; no dress code

Reach out to me directly at <christopher.wetherill@stateauto.com> if interested
[0] --- https://www.dispatch.com/news/20180422/state-auto-ceo-readies-insurer-for-wave-of-change
[1] --- Only mentioning this because "IT at an insurance company" usually means "months-long development cycles." That ain't us.

We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly.

Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers.

We are teaching machines to diagnose cancer in a collaborative research and development environment. You will be a direct report to the project lead, developing a broad codebase (NLP, NNs, bioinformatics, digital archaeology). Typical candidates that make it past the first interview have a technical PhD or hard STEM masters. Linear algebra is a prerequisite. At least 3-4 years writing code strongly recommended.

Collaborators include commercial, DoD, and other government entities. Project is based in San Diego but designed to accommodate remote work from the ground up.

Culturally, you will be expected to reduce highly ambiguous problems for yourself and others, including asking for help, often in domains you haven’t dealt with before, e.g. clinical trials, legally binding privacy requirements, and highly invasive security and compliance. Finally, this is a small group inside a huge organization. Long term, global, strategic thinking, excellent teamwork, and exemplary personal conduct are essential.

On-site locations are teaching hospitals. You will ride the elevator with the patients you’re trying to help: active duty military, veterans, and their families.

Smartly.io | Frontend Engineer (automated optimization tool)| Full time | ONSITE (Helsinki, Finland), relocation assistance |https://www.smartly.io/developer
The main focus of our team is to build automated optimization and A/B testing tools for our customers. While this means that we use advanced Bayesian modeling in the backend, we do our best to make everything as easy as humanly possible to our customers. Our customers are not statisticians, after all. And frankly, as a frontend developer, you don’t need to be, either.

Our current frontend stack consists of React typed with Flow and Typescript. Oldest parts of the codebase still use AngularJS, so being able to read AngularJS and refactor it to React is a plus.

We’re building the best product company to work for, where highly autonomous engineering teams take full ownership of creating a world-class software platform. As an engineer at Smartly.io you get to tackle challenges of considerable scale and complexity. We develop our product at a fast pace and in close cooperation with our customers.

We raised our Seed Round from Sequoia, have hired our first few engineers and are looking to complete the early team.

Intel manuals, section 2 of the man pages, 'linux programming interface', and 'linux kernel development' and such should be well thumbed documents/books for you. You don't need to know it by heart but it should not be unfamiliar and given time you should be able to implement any of it. Also comp. sci fundamentals are a must. We have much more complex data structures than simple trees/queues in our source. SMP, spinlocks, KVM internals, etc. it's all fair game.

Additionally, supporting the number of languages that we do (https://repl.it/languages) is hard from both a hard systems tooling problem -- we have to build generic protocols for executing, debugging, authoring code, running tests, handling files, etc.
It's a great time to be joining us, we're still 8 full-time people, we reach more than a million coders a month, and we're backed by YC and a16z.

Namebase | SF and REMOTE | Full-time | https://namebase.io
Namebase is a domain registrar and onramp for the Handshake blockchain.
Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS. It's a protocol that's similar to Bitcoin, except that instead of using the coins for money, you use Handshake coins to register names on the Handshake blockchain. Handshake names are top-level domain names (.com, .io,. org, etc), and they're different from normal domain names because they're unstoppable; no one can censor, tamper with, or seize your name from you. Furthermore, Handshake names are associated with public keys, which enables SSL without relying on Certificate Authorities (a failure point in the security of DNS today).

Namebase is a domain registrar and exchange for Handshake (we're a separate company from the Handshake Foundation). You can register and manage Handshake names on our website, and if you don't have any coins, you can buy some using dollars or bitcoin on our exchange.

We're looking for a generalist marketer to run content marketing, community events, influencer marketing, SEO, and various growth experiments. If you have experience in developer relations that's a big plus!
Our mission at Namebase is to give an unstoppable name to everyone on the internet. Handshake makes it possible to have DNS that can't be shut down — even the Great Firewall of China can't censor Handshake names. We have the opportunity to change how the internet works, and our team is small enough that you'll have immense impact on our software development and company direction. Importantly, we don't have to do this alone. Our community is incredibly engaged and willing to help out, much more so than a traditional startup because we're working on a movement rather than a product. Message tieshun @ our domain if you're interested in leading this movement to build an unstoppable internet!

Waive | Los Angeles LA Hollywood | Fullstack PHP Python Mobile Native Automotive | Onsite - Full-Time | DoE
We're a (mostly) electric urban mobility company founded in 2015, a bit before the current wave of them being everywhere.

I'm running a team of 6 engineers and am looking for a few more at our family-sized company which may be doing some scaling soon. We have tens of thousands of customers, millions in assets, planning international expansion, it's a real thing.

Here's our plan for the next year or so, listed in order (highest first):

* a new ad platform for our screens

* a new app or some other kind of smartphone presence

* New innovative ad tech (see firefly, grabbit, blip, adomni, etc)

Any decent full stack or native mobile developer would be simply magical, especially the latter; we will be needing Android and iOS focus soon and to be honest I can't allocate anyone I have on it. Yeah, you're kinda needed
So just email me already at chris@waive.car ... you've already made it this far.

Location: BC, Canada
Remote Only

Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, JS/Typescript, Rails, PHP, SQL, Many CSS preprocessors, AWS, Heroku

I'm a competent C and C++ programmer. The C++ spec weighs a lot, so I'm hesitant to call myself an expert, but I have a good working knowledge of the languages. For a previous employer I worked on a commercial Windows IDE for ~3 years.

I've been working on the foundations of a 3D game engine for ~3 years, which has taught me a great deal about C, systems and graphics programming on both Win32 and Linux. I chose to build it without libraries (Handmade Hero style) which began as a learning exercise, but ended up teaching me to value simplicity much more than I expected.

I can configure and maintain webservers, proxies and load balancers having worked with the web for 10 years.

I have a good understanding of the Linux network stack and APIs at the systems level - I've worked on several custom TCP + UDP protocols in the past.

I love building tools. Sometimes I feel like I was made to build tools. I build all kinds of tools - tools for computers, tools for automotive maintenance, tools for making tools. I've been building a game engine, which I would consider a collection of tools, for years and I still enjoy working on it.

Lastly, and I think this is interrelated with the tools thing, I'm a systems programmer at heart. I love having direct access to the chip and needing to understand the hardware architecture, as opposed to the internals of an interpreter, to write well-working and well-performing code.

That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase "Have strong opinions, weakly held".

I enjoy backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing, hiking, biking and beer! I live in a small town called Nelson in British Columbia, Canada and would strongly prefer to work remotely. I've been working remotely for several years for companies in the SF bay area and love it!
If you think I could be a good fit for your team and would like to chat I can be contacted by email at jesse.hughes.it@gmail.com

Inventables | Chicago, IL | ONSITE
My team is hiring software engineers. We make and sell CNC carving machines for entrepreneurs and small businesses. (Think of the opposite of a 3d printer - instead of using filament to create a physical object from a design, our machines use a cutting bit to carve out a design from wood, plastic, or metal). We write software for every step of the process, from purchasing the machine and materials to creating a design to driving the machine.
I've been working here as a software engineer for three years, and have really been enjoying. The roles we're hiring for are for a new team that I'm excited to be building.  You can see details (and apply) at https://www.inventables.com/careers/software

ProfitWell (https://www.profitwell.com) | Backend (Python), Frontend (TypeScript/React), DevOps (Kubernetes) | Mid + Senior level | Boston, MA | Full Time | ONSITE
ProfitWell provides free subscription metrics to help you identify opportunities and then tools to help you reduce churn, optimize pricing, and grow your subscription business end-to-end.

We care a lot about building great products, but also about writing great software. We have high standards for our code, and everything to push goes through a rigorous code review. We're ok if it takes a little longer to get things right because we believe it leads to better products, better software, and happier engineers in the long term. There's obviously a tradeoff between speed and quality, and while we're always trying to find the sweet spot, we tend to err on the side of shipping well designed software.

Related to this, engineers are expected to give input on the product. It's not "here's a spec, go build exactly what it says." We think building great products is a "contact sport," meaning there's typically a lot of (respectful!) debate and refinement over the things we build before they reach their final form. This means pointing out the UI inconsistencies and UX awkwardness when starting to build out the frontend or coming up with novel ways to leverage the immense dataset we have on the backend to drive better outcomes for our customers.

We also do a lot of team activities here. Whether it's trivia or game nights, or lunch with the team, or our bi-weekly lunch & learn where we rotate presenting to the rest of the engineering team on technical topics that are interesting to us. There's always something going on.

Society6 (Leaf Group) | Senior Frontend Engineer, Senior Backend Engineer | Santa Monica, CA | Full-time | Onsite | https://society6.com
Society6 is a marketplace where artists can sell their artwork, printed onto a variety of different product types (wall art, furniture, throw pillows, iPhone cases, etc). All orders are printed on demand from our network of vendors located in US, Europe, and Australia, and drop shipped to the buyer.

In 2018, as part of the Leaf Group marketplaces division, over 1.4M transactions were placed and over $116M in revenue. A major portion of that was generated by Society6. We have over 6M pieces of artwork from over 350K artists. Many of our artists make a living just from royalties earned from selling on Society6. Our website primarily focuses on consumers, but we also have a wholesale business that grew 27% YoY last quarter.

Some exciting projects to work on include vast improvements to search and discovery for artwork, artist studio and sales dashboard, merchandising tools, CRM for wholesale, improvements to our vendor integrations, performance improvements, and much more.

I have joined the organization recently as VP of Engineering, and what I have found is a platform that has served Society6 well, facilitating impressive growth, but needs a great deal of refactoring.

I'm looking for backend engineers with senior level or greater experience that work on existing legacy code, and strategize with a team of other experienced engineers to maintain, refactor or wholly replace existing code.

Here's a tour I gave for when I was looking for potential housemates - the room shown here is the one you'd be in: https://syd.jjcm.org/house.mp4 I've got surfboards if as well if you're into that, and the snorkeling just out front is some of the best in Sydney: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKrdldogMLw

About the job:

Position is from now until March. Three days a week on my project gets you a free room and free food. Creating a Patreon meets Reddit kinda site. User pays $5/mo, we take $1 to run the servers without ads or tracking, then the remaining $4 gets split evenly between everything they upvoted that month. Philosophies I'm going into this with: Entirely open source, no ads ever, all analytics are purely opt-in. I'm a front end guy and right now I'm grinding my gears with the backend, so anyone that can create node apis secured with JWTs is really who I need. Big bonus points if you've worked with Stripe's API or cloud storage before. If you're interested in the roadmap for what you'd be doing, I have an 8 week sprint planned out here: https://github.com/jjcm/soci/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open

Lancaster University | Senior Research Associate/Research Associate: Collaborative Technologies in Underwater Robotics and Computer Vision | Lancaster, UK | Onsite
A research position is available to work on an exciting, cross-disciplinary million pound project with a team of industrial partners (including QinetiQ, Nuvia, Bristol Maritime Robotics Ltd and Fortis Mechanical Design Ltd) funded by Innovate UK to investigate and develop next generation autonomous robotic systems that will operate in hazardous underwater environment with little direct human involvement. The research challenges include development of the situation awareness using tactile and passive EO sensors, navigation using sonar SLAM and decision making with elements of autonomy and objects recognition in challenging environments from sonar images using newly developed transparent/interpretable deep learning for advanced computer vision. Simulations will be performed using ROS and programming will be with Python (C or Matlab may also be considered for some developmental steps, but the expertise with Python and ROS is critically important).

In the project you will collaborate with an experienced team of industrial experts and will be performing challenging research tasks leading to the implementation of advanced algorithms on software (Python), testing and validating the results in simulation (in ROS) and ultimately on laboratory scale mobile robots (unmanned ground based vehicles). The results will be integrated in systems with industrial significance and national importance.

You will be an expert in the area of mobile robotics, autonomous systems, control and navigation with interest to SLAM and decommissioning and keen to learn more about computer vision and transparent deep learning.

We are particularly interested in applicants who are excited by the potential of working at the interface between disciplines.

A PhD degree (or being in a process of submission of a PhD) or equivalent in Computer Science or Engineering or a closely-related field is required to be eligible for this position. You will have a track record of high-quality publications in the areas of relevance to the project and the willingness to undertake ambitious and challenging research. For more details, please see the detailed Job Descriptions/Person Specifications for these positions.

Senior Java Developer | InnoGames https://www.innogames.com | Hamburg, Germany | Full Time  | Onsite
InnoGames, based in Hamburg, is one of the leading developers and publishers of online games with more than 200 million registered players around the world. Currently, more than 400 people from 30 nations are working in the Hamburg-based headquarters.

Your mission:


    - Develop features shared across our game backends
    - Improve performance-critical components, increase the robustness and scalability of our software
    - Improve our libraries and backend services with your knowledge of software architecture and high-quality code
    - Maintain and extend our development tools and environment

Your Profile:

    - Several years of experience in object-oriented programming in Java with Spring Boot and the Akka framework
    - Software development with Spring, the UNIX command line and profound knowledge of SQL, GIT, and Continuous Delivery
    - Solid experience in using various methods in software design and strong belief in automated testing to guarantee and improve code quality in compliance with the company standards
    - Being a backend geek, you also sometimes like to switch to the frontend side with Angular, C# and Unity
    - Good English language and overall communication skills
    - Proactive and motivated individual with a willingness to learn

Personal note:
I as a software developer myself was initially rather critical about taking a position at a gaming company due to stories of crunch time and low pay, but my experience has been very positive in both regards at InnoGames: Crunch time does not really apply to a mobile gaming company (very few hard deadlines), and especially not to our team, as it is not a game team; and I was offered a better compensation package than what I had initially asked for. The workflow and processes in the team are driven by ourselves, and the two worlds of the job between creating and maintaining software on one side and providing support to game teams on the other are challenging in a very positive way and provide a lot of variety.

We have several open tech positions but this one is directly in my team so feel free to shoot me any questions about the position at dennis dot neufeld at innogames dot com

ReadCoor | Hardware Software Engineer and Pipeline Software Engineer | Cambridge, MA | ONSITE, REMOTE | https://www.readcoor.com
ReadCoor is a company developing a platform for DNA sequencing in 3D tissue. We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, chemists, hardware and software engineers building this technology to assist in the next leap of biological research and discovery.
Why 3D Spatial Sequencing?

Current state of the art DNA sequencing will tell you what raw "source code" you have. Various RNA sequencing technologies and recent single cell techniques will give you "runtime configuration" information. These techniques will tell you what molecules are present in a tissue, but they do not tell you where the molecules are located.

Our sequencing technology maps their location in exquisite detail. We can, for example tell you not just that a virus’s DNA was found in a sample, but also allow you to view the intact tissue and see which individual cells were infected. We apply this technology to all areas of biomedical research including infectious disease, neuroscience, and cancer biology.

Pipeline Software Engineer

Our backend pipeline engineering role is responsible for building and scaling out our ingestion and processing pipeline.

This pipeline uses a lot of python (numpy, scipy, skimage, pandas, dask, zarr to name a few libraries) to process individual tissue samples which range in size from 1-5 TB of images (and growing).

UI Developer

Our UI Developers are responsible for creating our web-facing data visualizations and statistical tooling as well as working with the hardware engineers and biologists to create cutting edge sequencing interfaces.

Our UI team uses JS, focusing primarily on React/Redux and Typescript.

Bioinformatics Developer

Our Bioinformatic Developers are responsible for interfacing with our biologists, primer design, and creating bioinformatic pipelines and analyses to support our three-dimensional spatial sequencing.

Our bioinfomatic team uses python and a suite of AWS services to facilitate

If you are not a Software Engineer, we're also hiring all sorts of scientists!

Hack Club (https://hackclub.com) | Director of Club Operations | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE
Launched 3 years ago, Hack Club is a nonprofit global network of student-led hacker clubs across 35 states and 17 countries, impacting thousands of students each year. Our programs span hundreds of after-school clubs, dozens of student-led hackathons, a vibrant online Slack community with thousands of students, and a fiscal sponsorship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship) program that recently crossed $700K in transactions and frontpaged Hacker News a few months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241).

We’re looking to bring in a Director of Club Operations to systematize and grow our primary program: clubs. You will own the end-to-end club experience, including processes to deliver high-quality mentorship to hundreds of club leaders worldwide, enabling Hack Club to scale beyond the number of calls our team can take in a week. If successful, this position will bring Hack Club from 2% of US high schools to becoming as ubiquitous and culturally foundational as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.

This role has C-level freedom, as well as responsibility. You will be tasked with solving the most challenging problems Hack Club faces as a rapidly growing student network. You must be able to work creatively and autonomously to design life-changing student experiences that you can simultaneously maintain and deliver to an ever-growing number of students.

Some examples of challenges to overcome:

- How do we build a diverse and representative community of student leaders and enable leaders to do the same within their clubs?

- How do we offer consistent value to students regardless of their financial background, making the club experience as powerful in Zimbabwe as it is in Cincinnati?

- How do we provide high-quality mentorship and coaching to a large body of student leaders, and bring students into the process of onboarding other clubs?

- How do we ensure that clubs survive the graduation of their leaders?

We need an obsessive, product-minded, operationally-excellent person with past experience growing direct-service programs and an intense focus on the student experience.
Interested? Email me at zach@hackclub.com with a detailed overview of why you think you’d be a good fit for this role.

We're growing so fast that I have to hire another 10 engineers just for my group in 2019. Back-end, front-end, mobile... you name it, we need the help (see all of them here: https://www.indigoag.com/join-us ).

Our tech stack includes AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (DevOps), Postgres (DB), Node & GraphQL (back-end), React & Apollo (front-end), and Python (data science / comp bio).

Hi folks, I recently left Google (8 years, 4 months, 4 days :)) and co-founded a deep learning startup. We’re building a large scale model to learn human behavior and detect, predict, and explain suspicion and fraud. Our focus is on insurance involving human beings, accidents and their health - such as disability, workers’ compensation and other areas.
“Insurance” may sound like a boring problem domain, but it’s far from that. On the ethical side, it’s a huge problem, with estimated $40B-$80B paid out to fraud annually, with very little recourse to the fraudsters. And we’re all paying for it. The detection process today is almost entirely manual/human intuition based, not data driven. Our mission is to put a stop to this loop hole by leveraging large historical data sets and deep learning and introducing a modern, systematic real-time detection approach. We put it in the hands of professional detectives. We provide realtime monitoring, alerts, explanations and supporting evidence.

The data set is a time series of events starting with an accident + injury, followed up by many diagnosis, interviews, witness statements, medical reports; treatments, with some final outcome. The outcome can be a full recovery, partial disability or a permanent disability.

This time series is represented by a large structured as well as large unstructured corpus (10s of millions of documents). The problem domain is super interesting - we’re building a real world “Minority Report” to stop bad actors from abusing the system, and help the good actors get paid immediately, and stop bad medical providers from doing evil.

There is a lot of interesting NLP work. The data sets you’d be working with involve individual demographics, job histories, geography mapping, health history, injury causes, recovery and treatment methods, objective witness statements and subjective claimant reports, industry codes, criminology, graph theory and workplace safety, to name a few.

https://www.propublica.org/article/dr-death-christopher-duntsch-a-surgeon-so-bad-it-was-criminal
We’re hiring one more data engineer and/or data scientist with strong programming python skills to join the team. We are super early so you’re getting in on the ground floor, but we are well funded (closed a large seed round recently from several top-tier VC’s in SF and NYC). We already have a large data set and a customer and are seeing early success with our initial model. Our office is in the middle of Manhattan.

You’d be working along side industry experts and researchers. We’re building a company culture taking the best engineering and cultural practices from Google and mixing in the freedom of working at a startup.

You can publish white papers and speak at conferences. We’re working closely with Google (TF + cloud teams) so you’ll also get access to that resource. You can use your favorite tools, including PyTorch and FastAI, and get access to powerful VM’s.
If you’re interested in the current position, or want to reach out and stay in touch for when we start hiring again, or want to collaborate because you’re working on a similar problem, connect with me on linkedin (mention hn/yc) or email me: tomasv at deepfraud dot com.

Designer/Developer | NewsNow.co.uk | London, UK  | Full-time, permanent

Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

In-Q-Tel | Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, SRE, Data Scientist | Washington, DC | Full-time | onsite | https://iqt.org/
I'm looking for a couple people to conduct technical diligence on startups with me at IQT. The position will give you a broad perspective on the startup ecosystem, introduce you to a wide variety of venture-stage investors, and teach you how the Intelligence Community actually works. These are full time roles based out of our Arlington, VA office.

There are two openings:

The first is for someone with a data engineering background: https://careers-iqt.icims.com/jobs/1119/technology-architect---data-engineering/job

The second is for someone with an SRE or DevOps Engineering background: https://careers-iqt.icims.com/jobs/1118/technology-architect---cloud-%26-software-operations/job

Both roles are great for someone who wants to build towards an architect or CTO role. Happy to answer any questions; don’t hesitate to reach out. web@peterbronez.com or see Keybase: https://keybase.io/peterbronez

About In-Q-Tel

IQT is the not-for-profit strategic investor that accelerates the development and delivery of cutting-edge technologies to national security agencies. Our work bridges the gap between the challenging technology needs of our government partners, the rapidly changing innovations of the startup world, and the venture community that funds those startups.

IQT occupies a distinct role at the intersection of all stakeholders – our government customers, the venture capital community, and the startup world. It is our access to and deep understanding of these diverse communities that fuel our ability to make relevant investments.

History

IQT was established in 1999 to ensure that our country’s intelligence agencies had access to innovative technologies from the startup community to help protect and preserve our nation’s security. CIA leaders recognized that technological innovation had largely shifted from the purview of government R&D and large organizations to entrepreneurs and the startup community who were developing much-needed technologies more quickly and less expensively, and continue to do so today.
As a not-for-profit strategic investor, IQT has connected visionary startups with a potent mix of support: financial resources in the form of strategic investments, market understanding, and engineering expertise to bring their technology to the intelligence community. Being able to translate between government customers and the startup community has enabled us to deliver on national security needs.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Fort Belvoir, Quantico, Washington D.C., or Reston:

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

These roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support. We're currently looking for folks in a number of US cities as well as Belgium, Canada, DACH region (Germany, Austria Switzerland), France, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

RaiseMe | Senior and Mid-level Full-stack Engineers | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE, Full-time | https://raise.me
RaiseMe is expanding access to higher education by reinventing how students earn scholarship dollars from colleges. Our platform allows colleges and universities to award incremental "micro-scholarships" to high school and community college students, based on academic, testing, extracurricular, and real-world experience.

We've partnered with with close to 300 colleges, and have users in 4 out of 5 high schools within the US. Many of our students earn tens-of-thousands of dollars for college. The coolest part of our platform is how it educates students about the possibility of college in the first place. Many of our users are first-generation college attendees, or minority or low-income students.

We closed our Series B in 2018, bringing our total funding to around $30M. Our investors include Salesforce Ventures, Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, The Emerson Collective, Teamworthy Ventures, and First Round, among others.

Magic | Full Remote Job | Full-time | Full-stack | Software Engineering
ABOUT THE COMPANY:

Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.

ABOUT THE POSITION:

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

ABOUT WORKING REMOTE:

This position is full remote and you can live wherever you want, or travel while you work with us. As our team is distributed across several time zones, compatibility with both UTC-7/8 and UTC+8 is helpful and willingness to participate in team meetings at non-standard times for 5-10 hours per week is ideal.

Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.

Bonus points if you've got...
- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins
- Experience within early-stage startups, remote, or human operations companiesApply here: https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hnr
