Kalepa | Software Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.

Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Earnin (https://www.earnin.com/) | Sr. Fullstack Engineer | Cloud DevOps Engineer | iOS Engineer | Android Engineer | ONSITE | Palo Alto, CA
Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don’t accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we’re working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people’s needs.

FreightFlows | Data/backend Engineer. Also Sales/Marketing and Product roles | Boston, MA USA | ONSITE or REMOTE
We're a new startup from Boston focused on the $20 Trillion dollar global seaborne trade market.

FreightFlows provides aggregated, predictive analytics for global trade. While maritime data continues to grow in volume and complexity, actionable insights continue to be elusive. The industry instead deals with inaccurate, stale and biased data from many fragmented sources. The complexity of bringing together trusted, timely information means companies have had to rely on dubious, incomplete market insight and therefore make decisions on anecdotal evidence. FreightFlows uses proprietary data science algorithms to synthesize data into trade truth, predictive analytics and actionable intelligence for traders, shippers, owners and brokers.

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.

ZeeWise | Atlanta/North GA | Software Developer | https://zeewise.com/ | USA REMOTE | Full-Time
ZeeWise is a very small software company that provides data aggregation and reporting for the franchise sector. We've actually been around for over a decade and have some very well-known customers despite our modest employee count. I'm one of the original tech founders and just took over as CEO. We're beginning the process of overhauling our product/tech stack.

We are looking to hire Software Developer(s) to tweak/update/transform our somewhat legacy platform into a more refined and scalable product.

Our stack is .NET and MSSQL with Angular (moving to Vue) on the frontend, however we're essentially rethinking everything so convince us why we should switch to your favorite stack instead of optimizing what we have.

Our platform has a lot of moving parts and though we are open to junior developers we're too small to be a training grounds/stepping stone position where you'll be compartmentalized to one tiny aspect of the product and playing ping-pong most of the day. We're ideally looking for senior/experienced devs (dare I say "full-stack") that are excited and confident about making systems architecture decisions that will have immediate real-world implications for tens of thousands of small businesses around the world. If you're junior but are confident in your abilities this might be an incredible opportunity and definitely don't be afraid to reach out.

We realize it is a very competitive market out there and are definitely prepared to pay competitive salaries for the right people no matter what level you're at (junior/mid/senior $80k-$150k+) and we're also prepared to negotiate ownership stakes/substantial stock options. As mentioned we're a small team and all have a very healthy work/life balance and a relaxed but productive work ethic.

Society6 is a marketplace where artists can sell their artwork, printed onto a variety of different product types (wall art, furniture, throw pillows, iPhone cases, etc). All orders are printed on demand from our network of vendors located in US, Europe, and Australia, and drop shipped to the buyer.

In 2018, as part of the Leaf Group marketplaces division, over 1.4M transactions were placed and over $116M in revenue. A major portion of that was generated by Society6. We have over 6M pieces of artwork from over 350K artists. Many of our artists make a living just from royalties earned from selling on Society6. Our website primarily focuses on consumers, but we also have a wholesale business that grew 27% YoY last quarter.

Some exciting projects to work on include vast improvements to search and discovery for artwork, artist studio and sales dashboard, merchandising tools, CRM for wholesale, improvements to our vendor integrations, performance improvements, and much more.

I have joined the organization recently as VP of Engineering, and what I have found is a platform that has served Society6 well, facilitating impressive growth, but needs a great deal of refactoring.

I'm looking for backend engineers with senior level or greater experience that work on existing legacy code, and strategize with a team of other experienced engineers to maintain, refactor or wholly replace existing code.

Hack Club (https://hackclub.com) | Director of Club Operations | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE
Launched 3 years ago, Hack Club is a nonprofit global network of student-led hacker clubs across 35 states and 17 countries, impacting thousands of students each year. Our programs span hundreds of after-school clubs, dozens of student-led hackathons, a vibrant online Slack community with thousands of students, and a fiscal sponsorship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship) program that recently crossed $700K in transactions and frontpaged Hacker News a few months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241).

We’re looking to bring in a Director of Club Operations to systematize and grow our primary program: clubs. You will own the end-to-end club experience, including processes to deliver high-quality mentorship to hundreds of club leaders worldwide, enabling Hack Club to scale beyond the number of calls our team can take in a week. If successful, this position will bring Hack Club from 2% of US high schools to becoming as ubiquitous and culturally foundational as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.

This role has C-level freedom, as well as responsibility. You will be tasked with solving the most challenging problems Hack Club faces as a rapidly growing student network. You must be able to work creatively and autonomously to design life-changing student experiences that you can simultaneously maintain and deliver to an ever-growing number of students.

- How do we build a diverse and representative community of student leaders and enable leaders to do the same within their clubs?

- How do we offer consistent value to students regardless of their financial background, making the club experience as powerful in Zimbabwe as it is in Cincinnati?

- How do we provide high-quality mentorship and coaching to a large body of student leaders, and bring students into the process of onboarding other clubs?

- How do we ensure that clubs survive the graduation of their leaders?

We need an obsessive, product-minded, operationally-excellent person with past experience growing direct-service programs and an intense focus on the student experience.
Interested? Email me at zach@hackclub.com with a detailed overview of why you think you’d be a good fit for this role.

Hi folks, I recently left Google (8 years, 4 months, 4 days :)) and co-founded a deep learning startup. We’re building a large scale model to learn human behavior and detect, predict, and explain suspicion and fraud. Our focus is on insurance involving human beings, accidents and their health - such as disability, workers’ compensation and other areas.
“Insurance” may sound like a boring problem domain, but it’s far from that. On the ethical side, it’s a huge problem, with estimated $40B-$80B paid out to fraud annually, with very little recourse to the fraudsters. And we’re all paying for it. The detection process today is almost entirely manual/human intuition based, not data driven. Our mission is to put a stop to this loop hole by leveraging large historical data sets and deep learning and introducing a modern, systematic real-time detection approach. We put it in the hands of professional detectives. We provide realtime monitoring, alerts, explanations and supporting evidence.

The data set is a time series of events starting with an accident + injury, followed up by many diagnosis, interviews, witness statements, medical reports; treatments, with some final outcome. The outcome can be a full recovery, partial disability or a permanent disability.

This time series is represented by a large structured as well as large unstructured corpus (10s of millions of documents). The problem domain is super interesting - we’re building a real world “Minority Report” to stop bad actors from abusing the system, and help the good actors get paid immediately, and stop bad medical providers from doing evil.

There is a lot of interesting NLP work. The data sets you’d be working with involve individual demographics, job histories, geography mapping, health history, injury causes, recovery and treatment methods, objective witness statements and subjective claimant reports, industry codes, criminology, graph theory and workplace safety, to name a few.

https://www.propublica.org/article/dr-death-christopher-duntsch-a-surgeon-so-bad-it-was-criminal
We’re hiring one more data engineer and/or data scientist with strong programming python skills to join the team. We are super early so you’re getting in on the ground floor, but we are well funded (closed a large seed round recently from several top-tier VC’s in SF and NYC). We already have a large data set and a customer and are seeing early success with our initial model. Our office is in the middle of Manhattan.

You’d be working along side industry experts and researchers. We’re building a company culture taking the best engineering and cultural practices from Google and mixing in the freedom of working at a startup.

You can publish white papers and speak at conferences. We’re working closely with Google (TF + cloud teams) so you’ll also get access to that resource. You can use your favorite tools, including PyTorch and FastAI, and get access to powerful VM’s.
