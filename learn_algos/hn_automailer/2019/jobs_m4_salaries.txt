Root | Columbus, OH | Full-time | Onsite / partial remote | $80k-$150k |
https://root.engineering/

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 500 people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone. So, you're in luck.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.
Email us at either chris.evans@joinroot.com or tim.hill@joinroot.com to apply and we'll respond to you promptly.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. Almost a year ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. You can read more about us here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Transcriptic is turning life science into an information technology by creating a fully automated cloud wet lab. Scientists anywhere can define and (reproducibly!) run experiments over the internet on-demand and without investing up-front in a lab facility.
The Transcriptic Common Lab Environment (TCLE) takes Autoprotocol (http://autoprotocol.org/), a high-level JSON description of a biological protocol, and executes it on our custom-built robotic workcells. The protocols we handle routinely involve solving constraint programming models with thousands of variables and constraints in order to find the best plan that fulfills the scientist's biological intent.

Scientists manage their experiments through our web application or via our API. We provide a single platform that controls scientific devices from many vendors in a unified way, and an interface to control our automated labs.

Backend engineer (scheduling): https://www.transcriptic.com/hiring/?gh_jid=1092746 Full-stack engineer (web): https://www.transcriptic.com/hiring/?gh_jid=1236117 Front end engineer (web): https://www.transcriptic.com/hiring/?gh_jid=1535939

Zoba is a platform for analyzing, visualizing, and optimizing spatial data. Our mission is to “improve the efficiency of cities and the lives of people that live in them.” Right now, our customers are primarily (micro)mobility companies interested in questions like “where should we place our vehicles” and “how should we rebalance our fleet?”

Presently we’re a team of 6 people who believe hard in the power and importance of cities as engines of human well-being. We’re looking for a backend engineer with a few years of experience to work on our API, which is primarily used by data scientists at client companies. Our backend stack is Python, Django, Postgres/PostGIS, and AWS. Other tools we use include NodeJS, React, Julia, and Gurobi. Of course, we’re always looking for talented, thoughtful, kind people, so if you’re an engineer or data scientist interested in what we do, please get in touch!

We work hard to make Zoba an actively great place to work. Perks include:

- Sane working hours (e.g. since I joined last fall, I’ve yet to work a single night or weekend, though it may happen eventually)

- Unlimited vacation policy, with a suggested minimum number of days (to avoid the slide to people trying to be tough by taking 0 days)

- Roughly biweekly seminars on team members’ interests, typically not directly work related

- Weekly team lunches

- Have plenty of runway and backed by excellent investors including CRV, Founder Collective, Mark Cuban, and Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom

To talk about any and all job opportunities or general questions, you can contact our cofounder Joseph at joseph@zoba.com. You can also check out a more formal job posting at zoba.com/careers. My role at Zoba is lead data scientist and, empirically, team baker [0]. I’m available at evan@zoba.com if you want to chat.

Bagel Health (YC W19) First employee (Full-stack engineer) REMOTE
Work at a YC startup trying to fix healthcare! Bagel is a new electronic health record for the growing direct primary care (DPC) movement. Read more about DPC at dpcnation.org. DPC cuts insurance out of primary care. It makes no sense to use insurance to pay for basic or routine medical services; do you use your car insurance to pay for an oil change? There are some seriously great knock-on benefits of getting rid of insurance too.

Looking for someone who is willing to work below market (roughly ~$60k annualized) until we raise money in 6 months or so. Then the compensation can increase to market rates. Compensation also includes very generous first-employee equity (~4%, standard vesting)

We're still in the early stages of implementation. You'll have a lot of responsibility over software design and architecture decisions.

Here's the tentative stack: Typescript, React, Postgres, Express, Google Cloud, and some Neo4j sprinkled in. Don't worry if you haven't used Neo4j before. Ideally you'd be awesome at a few of these and competent in the rest.
I'm Colin McDonnell, MIT grad, software engineer, the sole founder of Bagel, and nice person. If you're interested in working together, email me at colin(at)bagel(dot)md with a resume and a bit about you and why you're interested!

Curebase | Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | ONSITE
Biomedical R&D is at an all-time high, but clinical trials are still expensive, slow, and traditional. The reason is the limited pool of research hospitals which R&D sponsors (like pharmaceutical companies) can use to run their trials. The overhead and training required to do research constrains the supply of these research hospitals, and leads to massive inefficiency.

Curebase takes a new approach. We empower every physician to be a researcher with streamlined software. This lets us run any trial in parallel, and enables sponsors to bring their inventions to market faster than ever.

Today, we use our growing physician network to power studies in many exciting areas of medicine, such as smoking cessation, STD testing, and nutrition. We have also participated in Y Combinator S18 and raised $2.5MM in seed funding.

Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.
We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 9 people: 4 engineers, 1 designer and 4 others. I’m one of those 4 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!
Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.

FlowCommand (YC W16) | Full-Stack Engineer, Data Engineer, Sensor Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | $120k - $150k + 0.5% - 1.0% | https://angel.co/flowcommand
FlowCommand builds a new type of sensor and software system to monitor fluid infrastructure around the world for leaks, theft, spills, and performance. Fleets of our proprietary lightweight hardware generate raw acoustic data and then send that data directly to our server via cellular/satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed) in pipes.

A few upcoming projects:

We’re planning to send a robotic submarine 10,000 ft underwater to attach our sensors to pipelines sitting on the ocean floor, with the goal of detecting and stopping oil leaks that harm marine wildlife. Build the application that allows operators to monitor their pipeline for leaks and alert them to an impending environmental disaster.

Our Houston office has a remotely operable flow loop (ie an obstacle course for fluids) that allows us to approximate field conditions and gather raw acoustic data. The digital signal processing specialists who write our firmware need to capture test data, but the sensor processes millions of measurements per second, making it difficult to store and process the test data. Build a system that allows them to efficiently test their latest DSP algorithms under a variety of flow conditions.
Technologies we currently use:
Web Apps: Python, Django, React 
Data Pipeline: pandas, scikit-learn, Heroku/AWS 
Sensor Firmware: C++, System VerilogPlease reach out at jobs@flowcommand.com

Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

Chargefox | Melbourne, AU | Mid to senior software engineer | ONSITE | https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1196426058
Full time opportunity for a full-stack developer with expertise in React Native.

ABOUT CHARGEFOX

Chargefox is committed to sustainable mobility. We're Australia's largest open, electric vehicle (EV) network for modern EV's. As part of that, Chargefox raised $17 million to build a network of ultra-rapid chargers to connect major cities across the country, but that's only a fraction of what we do. We have an unwavering focus on simplifying the EV charging experience for everyone - be they drivers, fleet managers, charge station owners, car manufacturers, energy retailers or more.

Our customers can find, use and pay for electric vehicle charging using their mobile. We’re continually adding new stations to the Chargefox network. So far we've processed over 20,000 charging sessions on more than 500 plugs across Australia and New Zealand, dispensing a total of over 165MWh of electricity. That's enough electricity to power the average household for two decades, and we're still growing fast. We're excited!

Our apps are built in React Native, and we're looking for someone to join the team to help. Values really matter (really!), so we’re looking for someone who’s a great fit for these - (Customer Focus, Sustainability, Safety, Transparency, Integrity and Collaboration).

WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR
We're looking for someone with a deep expertise in React Native (experts in React or Android/iOS will be considered as well) who will be able to provide both technical leadership for the team and to also deliver features. At the same time you will be working and contributing on a variety of tasks including development and support of Ruby APIs, web applications and AWS infrastructure.
Remember our value on Customer Focus above? We want to see empathy for the driver and their experience along the way too.
We expect you to know how to build scalable and well architected software solutions. We're looking for engineers, rather than coders. At Chargefox, we are big believers in a pragmatic and agile approach to software development. You will be participating in team rituals including stand-ups, retrospectives, occasional pair-programming and on-call support. We are based in Melbourne, so you will be working in our office in the CBD.
SO, WHY US?
A chance to join a growing and dynamic start-up enabling the uptake of electric vehicles in Australia. This is a unique opportunity to be an integral part of something that is of true value to society.
We are fully funded and offer a competitive salary package.
A collaborative and supportive environment that will stretch you, but give you a chance to learn from and teach others.
We'll supply you with a new company laptop (if you need one).
If you think that we sound like a great place to work and you fit the bill, then please get in touch and send through your details.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Synthetic Minds (YC S18) | SF + Seattle | $120k+ | Engineer #5: commensurate equity | ONSITE, Full Time
The ideal candidate has a master/phd in systems, compilers, programming languages, or distributed systems. Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.

Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads/writes smart contracts in Ethereum's Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer's code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can even synthesize it.

In Oct 2018, we raised a $5.6M seed round from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [3]. We have paying customers and a backlog waiting to be on-boarded. This is the founder’s second startup and they have a PhD in the area. The 1st employee was the first hire at Parse (YC S11) and has 10 yrs at Google. We are currently hiring engineer #5, and aim to be a 15 person all-engineering team in 2019.

Roles/Openings [1]:

* Systems/infrastructure engineer — You’ll be working on distributing heavy CPU processes on AWS. Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node/process/memory/algorithm failures.

* Compilers/verification/synthesis engineer — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.

* Smart contract engineer — You'll be working on the front-end of the compiler, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis).

* Director, Product: https://careers-billtrust.icims.com/jobs/2075/director%2c-product/job

Tech Stack: Across our product portfolio we leverage a variety of languages, frameworks and tooling. Much of code is written in C#/.NET Core 2.x along with handful of other languages such as C++, PHP, Node.js and Java. For frontend, Angular 6+ on the newer products, and a few mature products leveraging Javascript and JQuery. Many databases to store our 200TB+ of production data including MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, DynamoDB & RDS.

We have some monolithic applications though new products & platforms are built using microservices running Docker containers on AWS ECS with some footprint in Azure. We leverage many AWS services – Lambda, CloudWatch, S3, EC2, Route53, IAM, SQS, SNS and more. We also use Terraform for configuring infrastructure, Jenkins for CI, and Git/GitLab for source code. These are flexible (they can and will change) and what a candidate knows for stack is not as important as their ability to think creatively – we can train languages, it’s much harder to train curiosity and intellectual drive.
