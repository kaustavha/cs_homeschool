University of California, Los Angeles Library | DevOps Systems Engineer | Los Angeles, CA | Full-time | Onsite | https://ucla.in/2IGcURR
We call our Linux Operations Engineering team here at the UCLA Library, Development Support. We do this because it embodies who we are as individuals and the relationships we cultivate with our colleagues. Our mission is to embrace DevOps as a culture, rather than a job description. The focal point of our efforts is to support the Library's software development projects by enabling our developer teammates to use the tools, infrastructure, procedures, and workflows to get the job done with as few hindrances as possible. Within our team, no one throws tasks or responsiblities over a wall - putting the burden on somoneone else. The phrase, "That's not my job", doesn't exist here. We understand that DevOps is everyone's job. We support one another, we don't point fingers of blame, and we see failure as an opportunity to learn.

If this resonates with you, and sounds like a environment you'd like to be a part of, please consider our open position for a Development Support Engineer within the UCLA Library's Digital Initiatives & Information Technology (DIIT) organization.
To learn more, please take a look at our offical job posting at UCLA Careers website: https://ucla.in/2IGcURR

In fall 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments; we're now processing over 200k payments every month.

In this role, you will be part of Wave's People Operations team and responsible for carrying out HR and administrative tasks needed to support the team.
Key details:
* Location: We are a remote company and you can be based anywhere between UTC -5 and +4 in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, the UK or US.
* Compensation: $45,000-$65,000 USD (or local equivalent) per year depending on experience, plus equity.
* Travel requirement: You will be expected to spend one week in Africa for company retreats every two months.Requirements: 3+ years of HR experience; native or fluent English; and local work authorization (wherever it is you'd like to be based).

Warby Parker | New York, NY | Engineering Manager, Data Engineering | Full-time | Onsite preferred but remote possible
As one of the original "clicks to bricks" retailers, Warby Parker has more interesting retail data than almost anybody else. We run our own supply chain, including an in-house optical lab; we built our own ERP; and, with a strong e-commerce site and close to 100 stores, our omnichannel game is on point.

One of our biggest challenges is getting all of that data into a coherent form and making it as easy as possible for analysts to use it. We're transitioning right now from an in-house PostgreSQL database to BigQuery, and in the process developing more mature data governance, data modeling, and general processes around data quality. And at the same time, we're working to take our ETL infrastructure to the next level.

We have a team of seven plus a Product Manager tackling this challenge, with more to come in the future.

What we need next is an Engineering Manager [0] to nurture this team into its next phase of development. Coach them to the next level, identify where we need to grow and succeed, and make it happen. Let's talk!

Matterport | Staff Software Engineer, 3D | Sunnyvale / San Francisco, CA | Full-time | ONSITE VISA
Matterport makes a 3D camera and web platform that allows users to easily capture and display 3D models of physical spaces. Check out some example spaces in our gallery: https://matterport.com/gallery

Some interesting facts about us:

* We host over 1,800,000 highly detailed 3D models of real places captured by our cameras, amounting to over 2PB of data.

* We serve over 60 million 3D views every month, which amounts to over 30 billion requests and 1PB of data.

The WebGL team makes our 3D viewing and editing applications for the web and VR. Core technologies include Typescript, THREE.js, WebGL and Preact. The team sits at the very end of our 3D pipeline: 3D data gets uploaded from our cameras, processed by our vision pipeline in C++, Python, and TensorFlow, before REST APIs serve the data to the WebGL and VR applications, which is what the end user sees.

If you already know "normal" web development quite well, and want to take the next step into the world of 3D and WebGL, send us a note!

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning through software and cutting-edge analytics leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/

About us: 
By design, security tokens aren’t confined to geographic borders, but they’re still subject to each country’s unique laws and regulations.

BlockRules technology brings regulatory compliance to the blockchain. We have built an on- chain engine that can ensure compliance with complex regulations from multiple countries. In addition, we have built a range of features that give users a simple, convenient way to interact directly with the blockchain, without exposing them to any of the off-chain security risks we see in similar platforms available today.

Software Engineers - All Levels - Junior through Principal: https://www.vectra.ai/about/careers?gh_jid=266929

Software Engineering Managers: https://www.vectra.ai/about/careers?gh_jid=1378166

Senior Front End Engineers: https://www.vectra.ai/about/careers?gh_jid=1378605

Our product, Cognito, is based on a simple principle for finding hidden threats: use an authoritative source of data and seek out the fundamental threat behaviors that cybercriminals can’t avoid when they carry out an attack.
To do this, Cognito relies on the only source of truth during a cyberattack – network traffic. Only traffic on the wire – whether in private data centers, public clouds or enterprise environments – reveals the truth with complete fidelity and independence. Low-fidelity perimeter security only shows what you’ve already seen, not the hidden attacks that were missed. Instead of traditional payload inspection, we use AI, machine learning and behavioral traffic analysis to expose the fundamental behaviors of attackers as they spy, spread, and steal in the network – even in encrypted traffic. For more details, see https://vectra.ai/how-it-works.

Chesapeake Technology a 50 person DoD R&D company supporting remote work with locations in Denver, MD, VA, and CA. We're looking for software, QA, and DevOps engineers with interest in SDR’s, networking, and visualization. We’re primarily a JVM shop integrating sensors and equipment into a 3D GIS tool for RF modeling and analysis that runs on Android, Web, and Desktop. We’re pushing hard for government open source! I’ve worked everything from CRDT’s to OpenGL shaders to even sewing sensors into a vest. Lots of opportunities to learn including graduate education and self-directed training. CTI just hosted an internal conference where all of the engineers got together at a game house and learned more about each other while trying to integrate SDR's with new wearable technology. We're looking for people that are passionate about RF and GIS and want to work in small teams. Schedules are flexible and we rely on tools to work asynchronously.

Whisper.ai | Firmware Engineer, Embedded Android Engineer, Embedded Audio DSP Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite
Whisper.ai is building the world’s first noise cancelling hearing aid system: it analyzes your audio in real time, automatically filtering out noise and amplifying the sounds you want to hear. Unlike traditional hearing aids, which simply amplify everything in the room, Whisper amplifies the person you’re listening to based on millions of audio prints it learns over time so it’s able to pick out who you’re listening to, even in the noisiest restaurant.

Based in San Francisco, Whisper is lucky to have the support of great investors including Sequoia Capital, First Round Capital, LUX Ventures, and more.
We're currently around 25 people and hoping to bring on a few more critical technical hires before starting clinical trials in a few months. It's an opportune time to join something small, with huge potential in a pretty sleepy industry. If you're interested, check out our job openings: https://boards.greenhouse.io/whisperai

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

We provides world-class digital marketing software and highly skilled professional marketing services through a single, powerful platform. We're currently building out version three of our flagship product, Marketing 360® and with that, looking to expand our software team.

We strive to focus on failing quickly and iterating, while writing maintainable and testable code and additionally used CiCd.

Glowforge  |  glowforge.com  | Senior UI/UX Product Designer (Growth)  | Seattle, WA | Onsite | Full Time
Glowforge is a beautiful device that sits on your desk. It uses a laser to carve and engrave products from raw materials like wood, leather, acrylic – even cardboard.

If you haven’t already, check out our video on glowforge.com. While you’re there, you’ll notice something amazing: Glowforge is the largest crowdfunding campaign in history. There is incredible demand for what we’re creating. It’s not a geeky tool for the tech elite or a garage workshop; we’re crafting an iconic product that is going to change the way people think about creativity. Our customers include consumers, digital designers, crafters, engineers, teachers, artists, and more.

Why We Need You?

Until now, maker tools have been excruciating to use. The software, the buying process, and the communication is shrouded in geek-code and insiderspeak.

Glowforge is different. We created a 3D laser printer that is simple enough that anyone can use it. And designers like you are the most inspiring customers of all. You can get a tiny taste of the talent and inspiration we’re talking about by looking at our customers’ work on https://instagram.com/explore/tags/glowforge/.

Our customers buy their Glowforge to create magic, but you are the one who makes that process magical. We need you to author the visual language that represents who we are, what we stand for, and the magic that we want to create in the world. It’s your design work that epitomizes the Glowforge experience, and we need you to be the best version of ourselves.

"Basically what we're looking for is someone who can be our engineer, who works on and contributes to the electron project. Our Electron expert."

For example, Electron has a current, long-running bug which is critical for us but not critical for the community at large: #12027 (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12027).

We rely on Electron; it’s a critical foundation to Finsemble, our platform for building enterprise HTML5 desktop applications. You’ll prioritize and implement improvements upstream to Electron, to support Finsemble in providing multi-application, multi-window deployments with interprocess communications that integrate otherwise disparate applications into a seamless unified experience.

Hazel Analytics | Data Scientist | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $150K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics is a fast-growing food tech company on a mission to create innovative products that change the way organizations use food safety data. Founded in 2014 by professors from Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Maryland, we're the proven market leader in health department data analytics, serving Amazon, Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, Whole Foods, and more — nearly half of the largest 100 food retail chains. Our platform transforms diffuse and disparate local health department data into actionable operational intelligence for our customers, who need to proactively monitor food safety and regulatory compliance while serving millions of meals every day. In recognition of our impact, we're a proud recipient of the Food Marketing Institute's Food Safety Innovation Award (2019) and Jack in the Box's Food Safety Innovation Award (2016).

We're currently seeking a data scientist who will help identify new opportunities and develop high-impact data analytics, predictive models, and statistical tools for our user community. You'll be expected to be both a creative and critical thinker, to have strong judgment in prioritization and execution, and to strike a balance between moving quickly and delivering high-trust analytics. You'll need to not only think and act like a leader but also roll up your sleeves and deliver production-ready models. Our tech stack predominantly features Python and R, but your input will be instrumental in further defining our architecture.

We're profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution. Personally, I was hired from a HN job thread — I'm looking forward to seeing some great HN applicants!
Apply here: https://jobs.lever.co/hazelanalytics/92c19146-aace-4a87-ad17-9bab28c4faa1?lever-origin=applied&lever-source%5B%5D=Hacker%20News

Zeal | Experienced Full Stack Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE
W2 and Contractor options available.

Zeal is a software consultancy. We work with a variety of companies, of varying sizes, and in various vertical markets. In every case our ultimate goal is to have them finish up feeling like they got more than they paid for.

That means that we have a great variety of projects for you to work on, with different challenges, and different business benefits to the client. This job is perfect for someone who gets tired of working on the same old thing all the time, and wants to be able to change it up sometimes.

Right now, we're specifically looking for experienced software developers who have worked on Rails back-end / React front-end or Node back-end / React front-end applications.

Our interview process is simple, and transparent.

1. As soon as you apply you'll get an email confirming that we got your application.

2. Someone reviews your application for some basic requirements (which are also listed on the application).

3. Next you'll have a short interview with someone, likely our Director of Consulting. This won't take more than 30 minutes.

4. After that we want to get some code to work on. We have a homework project you can use, or you can bring your own project as long as it includes Rails and React, or Node and React (depends on the position you're applying for). And it needs to be on your machine and ready to work on, because that's what we'll do together. If you use our homework, please timebox the task to no more than 2 hours.

5. Once you've got a project we can work on together, we'll schedule 2 back-to-back interviews with our engineers. 1 engineer in each interview. This won't take more than 90 minutes total.

6. After that, we review the feedback from the engineers, check your references, and extend an offer if we both agree it makes sense.

We hope you choose to apply. We'd love to get to know you.

Everactive | Data Scientist | Ann Arbor, MI | Full-time, ONSITE
Everactive (formerly PsiKick) is an industrial internet-of-things (IIOT) company that creates energy-harvesting batteryless sensors to monitor industrial equipment like steam traps and motors. Our founding team invented the lowest-power wake-up radios on the market, and we complement that IP with a full-stack solution spanning hardware, software, and analytics. We've got amazing investors and a long runway, and we're a platform that will scale to millions of sensors.

I'm looking for a Data Scientist to join me in our Ann Arbor office as the second member of the Data team. We're working to detect and predict state changes in the equipment we monitor. I'm focusing on the data infrastructure and pipeline and need help with the algorithmic state detection and building tools to help in-house domain experts to annotate our data as efficiently as possible. Our core sensor outputs are stationary time series, and several unique aspects mean we need creative solutions beyond standard ML and forecasting approaches.

As the second member of the team you will have significant input into how the data team operates and continues to grow. I'm looking for someone with several years industry experience and strong opinions about the right way to do things, including technology (tools, libraries) and process (workflow, hiring).

I work primarily in Python (numpy/pandas/etc) with some R (tidyverse, Shiny) and deploy to AWS with Docker (ECS, EKS). I'm parallel to (not within) the software team who also uses a lot of go and typescript. We love Postgres, are adopting Gitlab (including CI/CD), and are experimenting with Timescale, Pachyderm, Hasura, and others.

Please see here for more about us: https://everactive.com/about-us/

Hello fellow hackers and direct employers!
…I am sick of agencies and HR portals etc. All I  ended up was waste of time jumping through the circus hoops, while the only beneficiary was probably the agency who farmed resumes to sell them to some other client like the CDOs in Finance...

I am a largely self-taught, very highly motivated and the non-pedant efficiency-loving programmer since 2015 (Python, Rust, Julia mainly, but can learn fast), and since you are all talking about job offers, I want to ask for your opinion:

Would you hire a graduate of the www.launchschool.com ? I am contemplating solidifying my programming by blazing through their program since I have slow-learned code for 4 years, so I would not be a typical "studious beginner". I just want to fill some gaps as well as be able to ameliorate the word "self-taught" by adding Launchschool and its projects to my resume.

Any thoughts? Thank you for your valuable advice.
James Logari

- unlock opportunities for millions to have more control and creativity with respect to how they raise, share, transfer, coordinate and distribute wealth 
- empower more users and developers to make the web a space and tool that is defined by collaboration, consent, privacy, security, synergy and freedom
We are looking to hire our next teammate, someone who will share our passion for bringing these possibilites to life through leadership of front-end feature development with javascript (React and node.js).

## For the role of Frontend Engineer, we are looking for someone who will:
- be an effective contributor to [MetaMask's free and open source software](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/) from day 1 
- lead the development of front end features 
- facilitate growth of open source community contributions to MetaMask 
- improve MetaMask through effective review of pull requests, triaging and analysis of github issues, auditing and refactoring the codebase and improving our tests- proactively contribute to team discussions about UX design, technical issues, sprint and roadmap planning and improving team processes

- support their teammates performance and growth 
- be successful working within a fully remote environment 
- bring respect, patience and empathy to every interaction and relationship with coworkers and the community

Hi! I’m looking for a technical person to work with me on an early stage startup.
I’m building a system which invests startups' cash reserves in safe, highly liquid money market funds which yield over two percent annual interest, allowing them to grow their reserves without compromising access to funds. Furthermore, the system integrates checking accounts which allow startups to process transactions quickly and easily, and offers an intuitive online interface which allows them to track their progress through key metrics such as net cash flow, burn rate, and predicted runway.

We’re just beginning development so you have the ability to make a real impact on our systems and work in an agile environment.

Experience with building web applications with complex interfaces, backend systems, and security is important. Languages to know include frontend ones such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and JQuery, as well as backend ones such as PHP, Java, and C++. We’re flexible with the exact languages you know but you should be able to build complex web apps which can handle a large user base.

Experience with building highly secure systems is very important, since this is a financial services system potentially holding millions of dollars and therefore having serious consequences if hacked.

Ability to work quickly while still doing amazing work is also super important. Some people can get the job done by a deadline, but it’s not clean code. Others can write clean code but not meet the deadline. I’m looking for someone who can write beautiful code and beat the deadline doing it.

Do things which leave me wondering how it was even possible for you to do them. Surprise me, in the best possible way.

With every person I add to the team, I’m looking for someone smarter than anyone already on it. Basically, each new team member increases the average individual intelligence level of the team. I’m looking forward to working with people who meet and exceed that bar!

We are based in the Houston area. Local programmers are preferred but remote is perfectly acceptable.

Interns, students, etc. are very welcome. This is a very early stage company so compensation would be a significant amount of equity rather than cash, so I don’t expect people with cash obligations to work here full time (but feel free to contact me to work on this as a side project).

This is almost a cofounder role. You get to build a great company here, while doing great technical work.

You can reach me at ashutoshraiofficial@gmail.com.
Looking forward to working with the best and the brightest!

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (all levels) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

We're the fastest growing unicorn you've never heard of [0] and was just recently named CNBCs Most Disruptive Business beating out Airbnb, Stripe, Flexport, and more [3].

Indigo is revolutionizing agtech by offering better crops to farmers through technology. Agtech is one of the most underhyped technology trends [1] and we're serving a multi-trillion dollar marketplace services industry [2].

Our group is working on the Uber for Agriculture. We're developing a Transportation network to connect farmers with preferred carriers (trucks) to help them ship millions of bushels of grain across the United States. It's like a real world Traveling Salesman Problem with even more requirements.

We're growing so fast that I have to hire another 10 engineers just for my group in 2019. Back-end, front-end, mobile... you name it, we need the help (see all of them here: https://www.indigoag.com/join-us ).

Our tech stack includes AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (DevOps), Postgres (DB), Node & GraphQL (back-end), React & Apollo (front-end), and Python (data science / comp bio).

We also offer incredible perks. Free lunch (a rarity in Boston), massive commuter benefits (both MBTA and bicycling), fitness reimbursement, ample vacation; we really focus on and believe in both health and sustainability.

I'd be happy to tell you more, so feel free to PM me and I'll personally refer you to the company.

Manulife University | Int & Sr Software Engineer | 85K – 150K + Annual bonus up to 14% of salary | Waterloo & Montreal | ON-SITE | Full-time
Want to redefine enterprise education and help transform a global giant in the insurance/financial services industry?

Manulife (https://www.manulife.com) is investing heavily in continuous learning for its workforce and we are looking for talented software engineers to join our Manulife University team to teach, inspire and invent.  Manulife University or MU, as we like to call it, behaves very much like an educational institution, but within a corporate environment. We have onsite classrooms in multiple continents and MU students are expected to do nothing but learn while in class, which means no day to day distractions like team meetings, emails and so forth.

For four weeks straight, five days a week, eight hours a day, we teach students how to create microservice applications with NodeJS, how to create front-end apps with React and Redux, and much more.  And if you are wondering what our curriculum currently looks like, the following is just some of the modern technologies that we teach:

JavaScript (ES6), React, Redux, NodeJS, GraphQL, and Microservice Architecture

We are also always looking for new technologies and methodologies to teach, which will allow us to stay competitive and to attract/retain talent.  With MU, we are unlocking the secrets for how we can provide continuous learning at scale, that can be done in a way that makes business sense.  There are still a lot of challenges ahead of us and new technologies and processes that will need to be invented, but the future looks bright for continuous learning.

In the future we can see employees not only negotiating for vacation days, but for education days as well.  What we are trying to do with MU is truly ambitious, but we need talented software engineers with an entrepreneurial spirit, that can speak with credibility, confidence and humility, to help us make this happen.  If you are the type of software engineer that sees problems as opportunities and can speak with confidence in-front of one or a hundred, we’d love to hear from you.

We know we are not in the same tech league as giants like Google or Amazon, but we can offer you an opportunity that they can’t.  What they can’t do is provide you with an opportunity to help redefine enterprise education and transform a global giant with close to one trillion dollars in assets.  By joining the MU team, you’ll have a once in a life-time opportunity to help pioneer a new way of learning and teaching in enterprise, that can redefine how we work in the future.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with active Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS or TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area: https://www.tanium.com/apply-now/?gh_jid=1610524&gh_src=d2f26a7e1

As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

TAM roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support. We're currently looking for folks in a number of US cities as well as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, or Switzerland.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: I don't find it acceptable if you would accept this as part-time job while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with side-projects or other one single extra part-time job.
