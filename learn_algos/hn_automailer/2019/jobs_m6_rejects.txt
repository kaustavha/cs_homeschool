Eleos Technologies | Remote (US only) | Full time
Eleos Technologies is a growing 8-year-old company building communication software for truck drivers and field workers.

We’re helping a diverse mix of customers—from mom and pop operations to household names—improve how they communicate with their employees by tackling information overload, reducing phone calls, and eliminating obsolete technologies.

We're looking for someone to own and evolve our web backends. The primary backend is built on Erlang/OTP, plus supporting systems built in Clojure (image processing) and Ruby on Rails (dashboard, billing UI, those bits.) As a small team, we've all helped build and grow these systems, but we're ready for a specialist!

In addition to the above technologies, we're running on AWS, using PostgreSQL, although we're keen to remember that all these things are tools and not identities.
If that sounds fun and rewarding to you, the full description and info about applying are over here: https://eleostech.com/careers.html

Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because:
- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.
- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning through software and cutting-edge analytics leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/

LetsCompass | Front end developer | San Francisco / Boston / Remote | pre-product: https://www.letscompass.com/
We are a startup that is delivering transformative lead-generation and lead-enhancement solutions, as well as other point-solutions based on web scraping. We have a highly effective dynamic web scraper, with a focus on delivering customizable data sets to build and enhance sales leads. We believe that sales teams should be focused on selling - our product finds leads and automates the prospecting process, so sales teams can focus on what they do best.

We want to turn the sales process on its head. Instead of acquiring cheap / unreliable leads, and relying on an army of salespeople to prospect and qualify those targets, clients can use our software to set prospecting parameters from the start. That way, sales professionals can find the exact leads they want, and never prospect again.

We are hiring a front end dev to rebuild an outdated, existing front end for our new back end. We have repositioned our web scraper from a price comparison chrome plugin (linked above) to serve a more robust function as a lead generation tool. You would be integral in redesigning the front end for our new product!

Big Health | Engineering Manager (San Francisco), Senior Product Engineer (London, UK) | San Francisco, CA or London, UK, depending on role | ONSITE preferred, REMOTE for exceptional candidates | VISA
Are you passionate about mental health? At Big Health, we're building a digital medicine platform that uses clinically proven techniques to help our users deal with the problems of worry and sleeplessness.

Our evidence-based techniques draw on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and are already helping people back to good mental health.

We value tenacity, humility, ingenuity and soul. In my interactions with my colleagues, these shine through on a daily basis.

I'm working on the platform and integrations team as a Backend Engineer, and we're also hiring full stack engineers, front end engineers and mobile engineers. We have two offices (in London and SF), and for the right candidate we'd be open to sponsoring a visa or supporting a remote role.

We have a micro-service architecture deployed on AWS Lambda, and the backend is written in Python 3.6.

If you're interested, you can email our head of recruiting Lauren at lauren.lazo@Big health.com (no space) with a resume.
Or apply directly at https://jobs.lever.co/bighealth?lever-via=-u1ppSKpEp

YNAB | Full Stack Developer | Remote | Full Time
We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives.  Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.

You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).

You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.

Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).

You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application.

AWS Developer Tools | Seattle, NYC, Berlin | Developer | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/
AWS Dev Tools builds the tools that we all use for software development and CI/CD ... at least some of them :-). I'm leading a team (CodeStar) of impassioned developers trying to re-invent how we create, release, and iterate on software quickly and safely.

We're looking for engineers to build this out!  If you have experience with different languages (Python, Go, Java, Node, etc...), different platforms (Linux, iOS/Android, MacOS, Web Apps), different workflow tools (JIRA, Circle CI, Pivotal Tracker, etc...), different organizations (startups, enterprises, governments, universities), I'd like to hear from you.

I come from a startup background and the rest of the team has varied skills - you will learn ALOT here.  I'm also interested in talking to Product Managers or UX people with a strong interest in tools for building and shipping software.

PingCAP | Software Engineer | San Mateo and distributed | Full-Time | Remote | https://angel.co/pingcap-1/jobs
We make TiDB, an open source distributed scale-out database that is consistent, always online, and MySQL compatible. Our underlying distributed key-value layer, TiKV, is a CNCF project.

We have hundreds of users, some with 100+ TB of data. We need to keep scaling to larger datasets and find ways to help users access their data even faster.

Our tech stack is Rust, Go, Kubernetes, and TiDB itself! Many different technical skill sets can be put to use here. You can work on making TiDB run in the cloud, do low-level database hacking, work on documentation, or working with customers.

I am part of the international team that is oriented towards being remote, and we travel periodically to meet in person.

I like working with TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a skilled and friendly team. On a daily basis I learn new things about databases and the cloud, but I also get to apply my existing experiences to have a big impact.

Cavulus · Senior Developer (Ruby/JavaScript)

Do you enjoy spending time with your family, friends, and hobbies instead of working after hours or commuting? Or perhaps a work environment that plans its deadlines around your vacations, and not the other way around, with management that shields you from the vicissitudes of the outside world and leaves you the time you need for focused, deep, uninterrupted work?
Consider Cavulus. We've put together an all-remote development team and a suite of powerful tools to tackle problems in the healthcare space, an industry notorious for surviving on Cobol, flat-file systems, and old spreadsheets. Studies have shown that 30% of overall healthcare costs are directly attributable to these redundant and outdated processes. We've brought workflow automation, modern data science, advanced interface tools, real-time stream processing, and people together to bring healthcare costs down for everyone.

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

Wellcome Sanger Institute | Full-Time | On-site | Cambridge, UK
Hello! Do you know UNIX and how to responsibly manage compute, and want to work in an academic environment?

You could move to Cambridge and replace me:

https://jobs.sanger.ac.uk/vacancy/senior-bioinformatician-wormbase-388186.html

In fact you should do better than me, because it now says  senior and I wasn't a senior. I have really enjoyed working at this job, and I'm leaving it after a year and a half because I'm moving to the United States.

It's for a resource with genomes of parasitic worms. You'll support a small community of researchers that study host-parasite interactions, search for candidate new drugs, and in general are worth supporting.

The bread and butter of the job is writing and running code that moves data around and runs heavy computations on it, resulting in a new data release every few months. You'll help researchers at Sanger with their use of the resource, reply to helpdesk tickets, write to ask people for data, and go to conferences once or twice a year.

You'll be a Bioinformatician, not a Developer, which means your code can be as good as you want it to be, but there are no brownie points for it. There is opportunity to develop more stuff - I've had a half a year long greenfield project - but it's more important that releases happen, and that the data is correct.
The team is tiny, and the amount of good stuff you do will be limited by how much time you have, so this really suits someone who can handle responsibility well. It helps to know Perl and have bioinformatics experience but you can learn both on the job if you meet other prerequisites.

Flock Cover | London, United Kingdom | Senior Software Engineer / Software Engineer | Full time | Onsite | Permanent
Our insurance / risk intelligence startup seeks full-stack developers interested in building systems in a mix of Haskell, OCaml, typed JavaScript (Flow / TypeScript), React Native and PostgreSQL.

Flock provides drone operators both risk insights for individual flights and the ability to purchase micro-duration, 'real-time' insurance policies in case of crashes or vehicle loss. Large drones that fail in the wrong place, the wrong time can cause enormous amounts of damage, so our platform uses insurance pricing to incentivise smarter behaviour and reward careful pilots with cheaper insurance costs.

We are seed funded, are seeking series A, and have an engineering team of five. Presently our team makeup is of quite senior engineers, but we are very open to recruiting enthusiastic mid-weight and junior developers, particularly if you have an interest in type systems and functional programming.

Why Haskell? Because we think strong type systems, static analysis and provability are the best ways to ensure the reliability needed in financial services without sacrificing our ability to rapidly develop and deliver continuously. These are our core engineering values, and they matter to us far more than existing knowledge of particular languages and frameworks.

As such, we require no prior commercial Haskell experience, just a polyglot attitude and a broad familiarity with functional programming (perhaps in languages like JavaScript, Scala, Clojure or F#). JS experience would be helpful but is again not essential.
If you're interested, please find the full job specification here: https://flockcover.workable.com/j/E0ACFDBBEE

https://www.eli-beams.eu/en/careers/scientific/scientific-data-management-specialist-software-engineer/

The profile is intentionally a big vague because I can fill 2-3 roles (and a couple of more in the CS department)- and if the profile fits, create new ones. I can also see someone working closer to the DAQ chain or the e-infrastructure side.
Also (not so related to HN, but why not try): I'm always looking for LabVIEW and PLC developers..

Namebase | SF and REMOTE | Full-time | https://namebase.io
Namebase is a domain registrar and onramp for the Handshake blockchain.

Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS. It's a protocol that's similar to Bitcoin, except that instead of using the coins for money, you use Handshake coins to register names on the Handshake blockchain. Handshake names are top-level domain names (.com, .io,. org, etc), and they're different from normal domain names because they're unstoppable; no one can censor, tamper with, or seize your name from you. Furthermore, Handshake names are associated with public keys, which enables SSL without relying on Certificate Authorities (a failure point in the security of DNS today).

Namebase is a domain registrar and exchange for Handshake (we're a separate company from the Handshake Foundation). You can register and manage Handshake names on our website, and if you don't have any coins, you can buy some using dollars or bitcoin on our exchange.

We're looking for a distributed systems engineer to work on the core Handshake protocol. If you enjoy doing open-source work, are interested in distributed systems, game theory, and cryptography, then come join our team!

We're also hiring for a backend engineer. Building an exchange is a non-trivial task — you need to manage customer funds safely, maintain zero-downtime and latency, and implement strong security practices mirroring that of a financial institution. If this sounds interesting to you please reach out.
Our mission at Namebase is to give an unstoppable name to everyone on the internet. Handshake makes it possible to have DNS that can't be shut down — even the Great Firewall of China can't censor Handshake names. We have the opportunity to change how the internet works, and our team is small enough that you'll have immense impact on our software development and company direction. Message tieshun @ our domain if you're interested!

DataGrail | Senior / Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | $130k - $180k + 0.1% - %0.5 | ONSITE
Help us build a data privacy platform.

Data privacy and data protection should be a no-brainer, but the reality is that many organizations are ill-prepared to comply with privacy laws, so we're helping to streamline the entire process. In doing so, we believe this will help give users more control over their personal data.

We integrate with many saas solutions, data lakes (s3 + json/parquet/orc/etc) and data warehouses (redshift, snowflake, etc) to easily access, delete and/or anonymize data.

We have paying customers and have raised over $4m (with plenty of runway).

Our stack (and growing):

* aws (codedeploy, rds, athena, etc)

* ruby/rails, react, go

* postgres, redis, s3

Experience with data engineering or data science a plus.

commercetools | Software Engineer - Scala | On-Site | Full-Time | Berlin, Germany | https://commercetools.com/careers
We combine solving hard tech challenges you’d expect in a Silicon Valley startup with German work/life balance.

Our Backend-as-a-Service powers commerce in a wide range of industries, including automotive, robotics, gaming, on-demand printing, fashion and toys. We don’t run mom-and-pop stores - we excel for enterprise customers that need a commerce platform that is both customizable and yet highly scalable and reliable.

Some of the challenges you can help us with:

* Scaling a multi-tenant BaaS with heterogeneous traffic patterns. We continuously improve the performance of our code (written in Scala) as well as our persistence layer (MongoDB and ElasticSearch).

* Rework our data models where they aren’t suitable for our biggest enterprise customers. E.g. we need to support retailers with inventory across hundreds of stores.

* Multi-cloud, multi-region deployment: We offer our customers a choice between different cloud providers (including AWS and GCP) and regions.

* Adopt new technologies in our developer-facing products. E.g. we invest in GraphQL and CloudEvents, and participate in specification processes as well as Open Source projects.

We’re 150 people from 35 countries. We offer flexible work hours, home office and are parent friendly. I myself leave the office at 3:30pm three times a week to spend the afternoon with my son, and then spent another 2 hours working at home in the evening.
For the Scala job in our team see: https://commercetools-jobs.personio.de/job/41580 Feel free to message me if you have any questions at christoph DOT neijenhuis AT companyname DOT com (No recruiters, no agencies please.)

Sense | Data Engineer | Cambridge, MA | https://sense.com | Onsite or Remote
https://sense.workable.com/j/7D7B6612AC

Sense is building consumer hardware and mobile/web applications to help people understand their home energy consumption, see what's going on in their homes, and ultimately reduce their energy footprint. We're serious about having a real impact on climate change.

Our product is built on cutting-edge machine learning technology that analyzes detailed electrical data in real time to figure out what devices are on and how much power they're using. The data science team at Sense is responsible for developing these algorithms, and we're looking for a data engineer to join us. Our growing fleet of energy monitors is continuously streaming high volume energy data to the cloud data pipeline that powers our production and research systems. You will be responsible for the design, development, and operation of this critical infrastructure.

We're looking for someone who is:

* Excited about high-volume, realtime data and solving the challenges it poses.

* Passionate about building high-availability, performant, cost-effective, and scalable systems.

* Tenacious when tracking down production issues, digging into metrics and logs as needed to run a problem to the ground.
Sense is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Women, minorities, individuals with disabilities and protected veterans are encouraged to apply. Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to Sense’s values. We welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, abilities and perspectives and are a pleasant and supportive place to work.

Waldo Photos | Senior Software Engineers | Full-Time | Austin, TX or REMOTE (Globally)
Waldo Photos (https://waldophotos.com/) is a photo finding platform utilizing facial and object recognition to empower consumers to toss their selfie sticks, put their phones back in their pockets and live in the moment. Waldo is the only platform that removes all of the friction in getting photos of you taken by others and creates new opportunities for photographers to market and sell their photos. Users can enjoy life’s most precious events and automatically receive images taken of them right on their phones or share images of others they’ve taken without having to lift a finger – whether between friends and family or a professional photographer.

We are enjoying tremendous growth in summer camps and private schools, where photos are already a common way to connect and share experiences of the children with their parents, but locating the photos of your child or loved one becomes a job itself. And while camps and schools have been the first areas that Waldo has gained traction, the challenge of matching and delivery of the photos you care about is luckily not limited to just summer camps and schools which is further driving our product and market growth.

To meet this demand we are hiring immediately(and through the year) for:

* Senior Backend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/BE760CF400

* Senior Frontend Engineers : https://waldo-photos.workable.com/j/7038D86015

Our tech stack consists of predominantly of Python, Node, React, Redux, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes and AWS.

Our team is globally distributed, remote first, and highly collaborative where we are united in the vision of delivering quality as well as joy to our users. As part of the team you can expect:


   * Autonomy, voice and empowerment to make an impact
   * Market Competitive Salary
   * Stock options
   * Unlimited vacation policy
   * Fully remote work environment with a flexible work schedule
   * Startup growth and energy

If this interests you or you have questions, please reach out to me via email using the address in my profile and I will be happy to answer anything or you can apply directly via the links above.

Amazon Fulfillment Technology | Seattle, Toronto, Austin | Developers, Project Managers, Business Analysts | ONSITE (relocation available) | https://www.amazon.jobs
tl;dr: We make warehouses better. I can help you apply to a team doing cool things you like. My team is cool too.

Amazon Fulfillment Technology (AFT) is the division of Amazon focused on improving and optimizing the Amazon Fulfillment Centers (warehouses). We have teams in Seattle, Toronto and Austin. There are a lot of teams in all three offices working on interesting problems.

My team focuses on using machine learning to predict mismatches between our inventory database (where we think everything is) and reality (where things actually are). This helps ensure that when a customer orders an item they always receive their order on time. We own everything from the prediction, the work scheduling, the user experience for the tools, reporting, the whole problem from end to end.

Throughout my career here I've been mentored by incredible developers. I've always been challenged in terms of technical and personal growth. And despite what some may have said, I've never been mistreated by managers or cried at my desk :)

Want to work on a specific area? I can direct a resume to the right managers/teams. Interested in Amazon, but not Fulfillment? Happy to help you there too. Want to come work for the coolest team in Toronto, applying ML to a real world problem? There's an empty seat beside mine.
Feel free to email me any questions: this username at company name dot com. Or just apply on https://www.amazon.jobs, but that's less interesting.

Recursion Pharmaceuticals | Salt Lake City, Utah | Onsite, Full-Time | http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers
We have raised over $80M to apply machine learning to one of the most unique datasets in existence - over 12 billion images of cells under a huge number of biological and chemical perturbations, generated in our own labs - in order to find treatments for hundreds of diseases. Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies. Among other awesome folks, Yoshua Bengio is one of our advisors, and helps our ML team come up with novel ways of tackling these problems.

We’re looking for:

* Data Scientists: Looking for experienced Data Scientists both for our Innovation and Assay Development as well as Image Analysis and Quality teams. You’ll work with our data, biology, high throughput screening (HTS), and engineering teams to identify and answer questions in high-dimensional data.

* Sr Full-Stack Engineer: Looking for a strong Full-Stack Engineer. Great opportunity for experienced engineers interested in coding for a meaningful purpose (and a massive human impact) and building distributed systems, web apps and tools for biologists.

* ML Researcher: Looking for a highly experienced senior/principal-level Machine Learning Researcher who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.

* ML Engineer: Looking for experienced Machine Learning Engineer who values experimentation and the rigorous use of the scientific method, high collaboration across multiple functions, and intense curiosity driving them to keep our systems cutting edge.
* Biologist, Computational Chemists, Automation Scientists, and Drug Discovery experts.

Logistics: Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiking/running/biking is literally out our back door, and it's half an hour to 6 ski resorts. Great pay, health insurance, 401k, relocation assistance (onsite is required), equity, fully-paid gym membership, complementary chef-prepared meals everyday, two one-week paid company closures in addition to flexible, generous vacation, 70ft onsite rock climbing wall, commuter benefits,  a top-caliber team, and help make a massively positive impact. Happy to sponsor/extend visas, but you need to already be authorized to work in the US--we can’t handle the lottery at this stage.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer &amp; more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: Please be a bit patient when expecting an answer as I'm travelling this week.

Hiring: Mid/Senior/Lead level software engineers, as well as front-end focused engineers who are comfortable with data-access design, development and optimization.

You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk's dev team if:

You are a full-stack engineer who wants to work everywhere, not just a small subset of components. Experience / interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes: client-side React & Redux, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, many-layered data pipeline (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.) that moves hundreds of thousands of items per second, and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all.

You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#/.Net, but specific experience here is not required.

Cool stuff about TTD:

Our platform processes 10million+ queries per second

Work with the best engineering team in AdTech

The combination of huge data sets, high throughput, low latency and amazing scale means that we're constantly solving some of the biggest challenges in computer science.

Truss | Infrastructure Engineer, Delivery Manager | San Francisco or DISTRIBUTED| https://truss.works
Particularly interested in Delivery Managers, and Infra Engineers with Javascript w/React, Go experience

Truss solves complex technical problems for the private sector and government. We helped rebuild Healthcare.gov after its public failure in 2013. We seek the highest standard both in terms of the technology we build, and the way we run our company. We'd love to chat with you.

We are a software consultancy known for pragmatism, autonomy, expertise, and trust. We build strong relationships with our clients, contractors, and employees and we believe that this is fundamental to doing great work. As a Truss engineer you will facilitate bringing Truss values (https://truss.works/values/) to those truly trying to make a difference in our government, and enable them to understand what their citizens actually need rather than implementing a perceived solution.
Here are some of the things we care about:
* Great communication! Including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing
* The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy
* Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools
* Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc.
* Experience deploying at least one application that other people use
* Have held at least one engineering position post-education
* Initiative, curiosity, a bias for action, and a problem-solving attitude
We expect all Truss engineers to consistently develop new skills, and cross-train into new disciplines outside of their current areas of expertise.

Check us out at: https://truss.works/ and apply at: https://truss.works/jobs/

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Quora | {ML, ML infrastructure} {Engineer, Engineering Manager} | Mountain View, CA | Full-time, ONSITE
Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. We are a web-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know.

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past year we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with active Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS or TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area: https://www.tanium.com/apply-now/?gh_jid=1610524&gh_src=d2f26a7e1

Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Meade, San Antonio, Scottsdale, or Tampa:

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Director of Strategic Accounts - We're looking for a number of sales people to fill various roles including, in particular, Director of Strategic Accounts.

These are primarily remote roles, looking for people based in Australia, Belgium, Denmark (or Southern Sweden), France, Germany, Switzerland, the US and the UK.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Sales#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

Frontapp | All Engineering roles | San Francisco, CA and Paris, France | ONSITE
Email is the universal communication tool for work. It’s where you discuss work, answer questions, and talk to all of your customers, vendors, and partners. But email wasn’t made for business and hasn’t evolved with the way you work with a team. So you’re dropping the ball, missing important context, and relying on many siloed apps that make you less productive as a whole.

With more than 5,000 customers and $79 million in funding from Sequoia, DFJ and others, Front is reinventing the inbox so people can accomplish more together. We’ve created one place where you communicate internally and externally, gain context about customers and projects, and access all your other tools so you can be more efficient, more fulfilled, and ultimately happier at work - https://frontapp.com

Hello, 
I'm super excited about this role, and I believe my skills line up very well with what you are looking for. 
Relevant skills:
  Unix&bash scripting
  BA in applied mathematics from UC Berkeley
  10 week study with Google engineers under their applied machine learning program.
  Familiarity with industry standard tools ( TF, Keras, Pands, Scipy, Numpy, etc. )
I'd love to chat more about the value I can bring to this position and help Lambda grow.
Best, 
Schuyler
