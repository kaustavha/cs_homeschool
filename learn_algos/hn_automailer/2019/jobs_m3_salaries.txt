We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone. So, you're in luck.

QuotaPath | Backend, Frontend or Full-stack Engineer | Philadelphia, PA or Austin, TX | $80K to $150K DOE | Full-Time | On-Site | https://www.quotapath.com/careers/ Happy new year, y’all!
Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.
We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 9 people: 4 engineers, 1 designer and 4 others. I’m one of those 4 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!

Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.
Feel free to reach out to me directly: eric at quotapath dot com

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. 10 Months ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. You can read more about us here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Synthetic Minds (YC S18) | SF + Seattle | $120k+ | First 5 engineers: commensurate equity | ONSITE, Full Time
The ideal candidate has a master/phd in systems, compilers, programming languages, or distributed systems. Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.

Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads/writes smart contracts in Ethereum's Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer's code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can “synthesize” it.

In Oct 2018, we raised $5.6M from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [6]. We have a backlog of customers waiting to be on-boarded. The team is experienced. This is my 2nd YC startup and I have a PhD in Program Synthesis. The 1st employee was the first hire at Parse (YC S11) and spent 10 yrs at Google. We aim to be a 10-15 person all-engineering team in 2019.

Roles/Openings (see [1]):

# Software engineer: Systems/infrastructure — You’ll be working on distributing heavy CPU processes on AWS. Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node/process/memory/algorithm failures.

# Software engineer: Compilers/verification/synthesis — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover [3]. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.

# Software engineer: Smart contracts — You’ll be working on the “front-end of the compiler”, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis). Desire to work at the compiler level of smart contracts is required, e.g., see [4] — experience in writing smart contracts is easily acquired as a side effect.
