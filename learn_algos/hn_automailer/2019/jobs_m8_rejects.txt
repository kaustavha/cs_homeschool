Distru (https://www.distru.com) | Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Product Designer, Product Marketer, Product Manager | Oakland, CA | REMOTE | Full-Time
Distru is a software platform for the cannabis supply chain. Our product helps cannabis companies manage production, sales, invoicing, and shipments, automating compliance with complicated state regulations that require real-time inventory tracking gram-by-gram. We are growing rapidly with over $500M in transactions per year passing through our platform, and we’re uniquely positioned to define trade in the growing cannabis industry.
We are a lean 9 person engineering-focused team that includes early engineers from Opendoor and Heroku. We are hiring experienced full-stack engineers and a product designer to help take our product to the next level. We love product-minded engineers that can own a feature across the frontend and backend, even if they're stronger at one side of that. Our tech stack is built from the ground up on Elixir/Phoenix, Postgres, React/Redux, and GraphQL.

After bootstrapping ourselves to profitability, we just closed our seed round with Felicis Ventures, Village Global, Global Founders Capital, and numerous notable angel investors including Elad Gil, Katie Stanton, and Avichal Garg: https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/distru-a-maker-of-supply-chain-software-for-the-cannabis-industry-has-raised-3-million-led-by-felicis/

P# team at Microsoft | Redmond, WA | Contract | Onsite
The P# team at Microsoft works on enabling developers to write reliable, well-designed and well-tested software through model checking and language integration techniques. The approach is reminiscent of TLA+ like techniques but differs in that the code _is_ the model and developers don't have to write models separate from the implementation. P# explores interesting paths through the state space a program can take and produces reproducible traces which can be used to debug and fix issues in services and distributed systems.
This position will involve a variety of tasks including writing samples and documentation to help P# gain wider adoption, and porting parts of the testing infrastructure to work on .NET core. It will also involve working on novel visualization techniques to aid debugging and comprehension of services and distributed systems.

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and increasingly Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

FullStory | Software Engineering, Mobile Frameworks | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA

FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web and mobile devices. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture. If things like Rust, app and framework disassembly, or reverse engineering sound like fun, we’d love to talk to talk.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!
Please submit via our jobs page: https://www.fullstory.com/jobs/

This is a rare opportunity to join an early-stage company that is improving the world, receives unsolicited “thank you” notes from its users every day for making their lives better, and is already profitable.

We started Mystery.org to create better explanations for every question children have about the world. We began with the 150 most common science questions that children ask teachers. We call this collection Mystery Science. Last year, more than 4 million children used Mystery Science in 50% of U.S. elementary schools. We’re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.

We’re now moving on to all the other questions children have that they’ll never learn in school. In the last 18 months we received over 500,000 questions from children eager for better explanations of the world.  Now we’re creating video explanations for every question.

Our goal is to create a generation of better thinkers. We think this is the most important problem to solve in the world today.
We're hiring engineers, product managers, and designers. Take a look at all of our open positions: https://about.mystery.org/jobs

Sqreen | Product Manager | Paris | Full-Time | Onsite |

Sqreen (YC W18) is an application security platform made for both engineering and security teams. We use dynamic instrumentation libraries that monitor web applications internals to detect security anomalies and block triggered vulnerabilities at runtime. Pretty much what an Application Performance Management tool (like New Relic) is doing, but for security.

We are currently looking for low-level Java (e.g. byte code instrumentation) and C/C++ developers to help us expand the capability of our agents, as well as backend developers (knowledgeable or willing to learn Python) to build new functionality on our backend.

Also, we're looking to hire our first Product Manager to define & work with the squads to keep delivering more value to our users.

Discord | Security Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime | ~$150k - $250k base + equity + hoodies (equity/hoodie split subject to negotiation)
Hello friends! We're hiring engineers for our brand new security engineering team. Check out the description here: https://discordapp.com/jobs/4362278002

Historically, Discord hasn't had a dedicated security team -- we just happen to have a small handful of engineers with a strong enough security background to pick up this kind of work in their spare time. We've since grown to the point where we finally have enough work to justify a full time security engineering team. Note that this team isn't just infrastructure security (although it certainly includes that) -- we'll also be building product features, new backend services, internal tooling, and more. If you have a solid grasp on software development, an extensive security background, and are excited about helping build a security team from the ground up, please get in touch!

Of course, if you're interested in working at Discord but not in this particular role, we have plenty of other openings at https://discordapp.com/jobs (but I'm not the hiring manager for those).
If you have any questions (about the role, Discord, resume advice, or whatever you feel like), feel free to add me on Discord at cmFtc2V5IzAwMDE=. Do note that I probably won't respond if it's a weekend (and your DM might get buried under the avalanche of work-related DMs by Monday). Last time I did this someone messaged me three Saturdays in a row and then angrily blocked me because I wasn't responding. If you're reading this: I'm sorry! Just message me on a weekday! :)

Joyent | Software Engineer | Remote, San Francisco, Vancouver, BC | https://www.joyent.com/about/careers/software-engineer-triton-object-storage-sf
The Product

The Triton Object Store, informally referred to as “Manta”, is a large-scale open-source object storage platform that is run across multiple geographical regions worldwide as a cloud service. Unlike other object storage products, it has strong consistency guarantees, it uses a Unix-like file system hierarchy for organizing objects, it supports containerized compute jobs on the storage nodes, and it supports multiple object links. Manta is run both as a public and private cloud service and on premises in many data centers. Architecturally, it is a large-scale distributed system composed of multiple microservices implemented in node.js and C with metadata state stored in PostgreSQL clusters. Additionally, we are exploring emerging languages and platforms for new development; e.g., Rust.

Candidates
We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code—software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.

Hazel Analytics | Data Scientist | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $150K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics is a fast-growing food tech company on a mission to create innovative products that change the way organizations use food safety data. Founded in 2014 by professors from Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Maryland, we're the proven market leader in health department data analytics, serving Amazon, Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, Whole Foods, and more — nearly half of the largest 100 food retail chains. Our platform transforms diffuse and disparate local health department data into actionable operational intelligence for our customers, who need to proactively monitor food safety and regulatory compliance while serving millions of meals every day. In recognition of our impact, we're a proud recipient of the Food Marketing Institute's Food Safety Innovation Award (2019) and Jack in the Box's Food Safety Innovation Award (2016).

We're currently seeking a data scientist who will help identify new opportunities and develop high-impact data analytics, predictive models, and statistical tools for our user community. You'll be expected to be both a creative and critical thinker, to have strong judgment in prioritization and execution, and to strike a balance between moving quickly and delivering high-trust analytics. You'll need to not only think and act like a leader but also roll up your sleeves and deliver production-ready models. Our tech stack predominantly features Python and R, but your input will be instrumental in further defining our architecture.

We're profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution. Personally, I was hired from a HN job thread — I'm looking forward to seeing some great HN applicants!

Picnic | React Native Developer | London | Onsite | Full time or contract
We're a tiny, but well-backed, team trying to build an alternative to the ad-funded social media platforms of today, by prioritising face-to-face time over screen time. Between us we've previously founded consumer tech businesses, led product teams, run a micro-VC and even launched a (secret) music career.

We are looking for React & React Native developers who love creating products that people want to use. You understand that apps—and code—are for people, not for computers, and always strive to make our app and codebase more understandable and easy to use.

You'll be helping to build an app using the latest best practices targeting the web, iOS and Android. We're using TypeScript across the stack, React with hooks client-side, an event-sourced architecture using PostgreSQL and Redis server-side, and GraphQL for type-safe communication between the two.

We've taken care to make our hiring process as transparent and stress-free as possible. We won't do any whiteboard / algorithm interviews, and you'll be paid for any take-home test we ask you to complete. We aim to give honest feedback after any interview, so that the process is not a waste of time for you even if the role is not a fit for you for whatever reason.
To apply, or to find out more about the role and our hiring process, check out https://www.notion.so/React-Native-Developer-16c3336b77754d24b7f8112a5d017c02

We are an early stage startup based in NYC and ATL. We have a small, tight-knit team that is flexible in how/where we work.

We have a solid MVP in market, early customers that are raving about us, and a big vision to solve a massive problem.

Our product is a mobile collaboration hub for residential construction teams and clients. In short, we are on a mission to make construction projects (new homes, renovations, etc) suck less for everyone involved. Our primary customers are small business owners - custom home builders, remodelers, interior designers, and others in the construction domain.

Our tech stack currently includes React, React Native, Ruby on Rails, and Postgres. We are deployed on Heroku. This stack may evolve or change over time - and this role will be the driving force behind the decisions for how we move our tech forward.

Santa Cruz and Cervelo Bicycles are looking for a front end developer to join our new shared web development team. You’ll work with a small team to create great online experiences as we enhance our rider facing and dealer facing web platforms.

Since we are a small team you’ll need to wear many hats.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/

You will be a direct report to the project lead, developing a broad codebase (NLP, NNs, bioinformatics, digital archaeology). Typical candidates that make it past the first interview have a technical PhD or hard STEM masters. Linear algebra is a prerequisite. At least 3-4 years writing code strongly recommended.

Collaborators include commercial, DoD, and other government entities. Project is based in San Diego but designed to accommodate remote work from the ground up.

Culturally, you will be expected to reduce highly ambiguous problems for yourself and others, including asking for help, often in domains you haven’t dealt with before, e.g. clinical trials, legally binding privacy requirements, and highly invasive security and compliance. Finally, this is a small group inside a huge organization. Long term, global, strategic thinking, excellent teamwork, and exemplary personal conduct are essential.

On-site locations are teaching hospitals. You will ride the elevator with the patients you’re trying to help: active duty military, veterans, and their families.

NanoVMs is building out safer and faster systems from the ground up (as in operating systems). We're venture backed and have really large customers. We open source as much as we can. We're looking for more kernel engineers.

We're specifically looking for those that have done kernel work before. The work does not lend itself to 'ramping up' easily. Intel manuals, section 2 of the man pages, 'linux programming interface', and 'linux kernel development' and such should be well thumbed documents/books for you. You don't need to know it by heart but it should not be unfamiliar and given time you should be able to implement any of it. Also comp. sci fundamentals are a must. We have much more complex data structures than simple trees/queues in our source. SMP, spinlocks, KVM internals, etc. it's all fair game.
Please reach out to ian at nanovms .

Namebase | SF and REMOTE | Full-time | https://namebase.io
Namebase is a domain registrar and onramp for the Handshake blockchain.
Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS. It's a protocol that's similar to Bitcoin, except that instead of using the coins for money, you use Handshake coins to register names on the Handshake blockchain. Handshake names are top-level domain names (.com, .io,. org, etc), and they're different from normal domain names because they're unstoppable; no one can censor, tamper with, or seize your name from you. Furthermore, Handshake names are associated with public keys, which enables SSL without relying on Certificate Authorities (a failure point in the security of DNS today).

Namebase is a domain registrar and exchange for Handshake (we're a separate company from the Handshake Foundation). You can register and manage Handshake names on our website, and if you don't have any coins, you can buy some using dollars or bitcoin on our exchange.

We're looking for a generalist marketer to run content marketing, community events, influencer marketing, SEO, and various growth experiments. If you have experience in developer relations that's a big plus!
Our mission at Namebase is to give an unstoppable name to everyone on the internet. Handshake makes it possible to have DNS that can't be shut down — even the Great Firewall of China can't censor Handshake names. We have the opportunity to change how the internet works, and our team is small enough that you'll have immense impact on our software development and company direction. Importantly, we don't have to do this alone.

Inventables | Chicago, IL | ONSITE
My team is hiring software engineers. We make and sell CNC carving machines for entrepreneurs and small businesses. (Think of the opposite of a 3d printer - instead of using filament to create a physical object from a design, our machines use a cutting bit to carve out a design from wood, plastic, or metal). We write software for every step of the process, from purchasing the machine and materials to creating a design to driving the machine.
I've been working here as a software engineer for three years, and have really been enjoying. The roles we're hiring for are for a new team that I'm excited to be building.  You can see details (and apply) at https://www.inventables.com/careers/software

Location: BC, Canada
Remote Only

Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, JS/Typescript, Rails, PHP, SQL, Many CSS preprocessors, AWS, Heroku

I'm a competent C and C++ programmer. The C++ spec weighs a lot, so I'm hesitant to call myself an expert, but I have a good working knowledge of the languages. For a previous employer I worked on a commercial Windows IDE for ~3 years.

I've been working on the foundations of a 3D game engine for ~3 years, which has taught me a great deal about C, systems and graphics programming on both Win32 and Linux. I chose to build it without libraries (Handmade Hero style) which began as a learning exercise, but ended up teaching me to value simplicity much more than I expected.

I can configure and maintain webservers, proxies and load balancers having worked with the web for 10 years.

I have a good understanding of the Linux network stack and APIs at the systems level - I've worked on several custom TCP + UDP protocols in the past.

I love building tools. Sometimes I feel like I was made to build tools. I build all kinds of tools - tools for computers, tools for automotive maintenance, tools for making tools. I've been building a game engine, which I would consider a collection of tools, for years and I still enjoy working on it.

Lastly, and I think this is interrelated with the tools thing, I'm a systems programmer at heart. I love having direct access to the chip and needing to understand the hardware architecture, as opposed to the internals of an interpreter, to write well-working and well-performing code.

That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase "Have strong opinions, weakly held".

I enjoy backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing, hiking, biking and beer! I live in a small town called Nelson in British Columbia, Canada and would strongly prefer to work remotely. I've been working remotely for several years for companies in the SF bay area and love it!
If you think I could be a good fit for your team and would like to chat I can be contacted by email at jesse.hughes.it@gmail.com

A research position is available to work on an exciting, cross-disciplinary million pound project with a team of industrial partners (including QinetiQ, Nuvia, Bristol Maritime Robotics Ltd and Fortis Mechanical Design Ltd) funded by Innovate UK to investigate and develop next generation autonomous robotic systems that will operate in hazardous underwater environment with little direct human involvement. The research challenges include development of the situation awareness using tactile and passive EO sensors, navigation using sonar SLAM and decision making with elements of autonomy and objects recognition in challenging environments from sonar images using newly developed transparent/interpretable deep learning for advanced computer vision.

In the project you will collaborate with an experienced team of industrial experts and will be performing challenging research tasks leading to the implementation of advanced algorithms on software (Python), testing and validating the results in simulation (in ROS) and ultimately on laboratory scale mobile robots (unmanned ground based vehicles). The results will be integrated in systems with industrial significance and national importance.

You will be an expert in the area of mobile robotics, autonomous systems, control and navigation with interest to SLAM and decommissioning and keen to learn more about computer vision and transparent deep learning.

We are particularly interested in applicants who are excited by the potential of working at the interface between disciplines.

A PhD degree (or being in a process of submission of a PhD) or equivalent in Computer Science or Engineering or a closely-related field is required to be eligible for this position. You will have a track record of high-quality publications in the areas of relevance to the project and the willingness to undertake ambitious and challenging research.

ReadCoor | Hardware Software Engineer and Pipeline Software Engineer | Cambridge, MA | ONSITE, REMOTE | https://www.readcoor.com
ReadCoor is a company developing a platform for DNA sequencing in 3D tissue. We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, chemists, hardware and software engineers building this technology to assist in the next leap of biological research and discovery.
Why 3D Spatial Sequencing?

Current state of the art DNA sequencing will tell you what raw "source code" you have. Various RNA sequencing technologies and recent single cell techniques will give you "runtime configuration" information. These techniques will tell you what molecules are present in a tissue, but they do not tell you where the molecules are located.

Our sequencing technology maps their location in exquisite detail. We can, for example tell you not just that a virus’s DNA was found in a sample, but also allow you to view the intact tissue and see which individual cells were infected. We apply this technology to all areas of biomedical research including infectious disease, neuroscience, and cancer biology.

Pipeline Software Engineer

Our backend pipeline engineering role is responsible for building and scaling out our ingestion and processing pipeline.

This pipeline uses a lot of python (numpy, scipy, skimage, pandas, dask, zarr to name a few libraries) to process individual tissue samples which range in size from 1-5 TB of images (and growing).

UI Developer

Our UI Developers are responsible for creating our web-facing data visualizations and statistical tooling as well as working with the hardware engineers and biologists to create cutting edge sequencing interfaces.

Our UI team uses JS, focusing primarily on React/Redux and Typescript.

Bioinformatics Developer

Our Bioinformatic Developers are responsible for interfacing with our biologists, primer design, and creating bioinformatic pipelines and analyses to support our three-dimensional spatial sequencing.

Our bioinfomatic team uses python and a suite of AWS services to facilitate

If you are not a Software Engineer, we're also hiring all sorts of scientists!

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (all levels) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

We're the fastest growing unicorn you've never heard of [0] and was just recently named CNBCs Most Disruptive Business beating out Airbnb, Stripe, Flexport, and more [3].

Indigo is revolutionizing agtech by offering better crops to farmers through technology. Agtech is one of the most underhyped technology trends [1] and we're serving a multi-trillion dollar marketplace services industry [2].

Our group is working on the Uber for Agriculture. We're developing a Transportation network to connect farmers with preferred carriers (trucks) to help them ship millions of bushels of grain across the United States. It's like a real world Traveling Salesman Problem with even more requirements.

We're growing so fast that I have to hire another 10 engineers just for my group in 2019. Back-end, front-end, mobile... you name it, we need the help (see all of them here: https://www.indigoag.com/join-us ).

Our tech stack includes AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (DevOps), Postgres (DB), Node & GraphQL (back-end), React & Apollo (front-end), and Python (data science / comp bio).

We also offer incredible perks. Free lunch (a rarity in Boston), massive commuter benefits (both MBTA and bicycling), fitness reimbursement, ample vacation; we really focus on and believe in both health and sustainability.

I'd be happy to tell you more, so feel free to PM me and I'll personally refer you to the company.

* Great communication! Including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing
* The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy
* Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools
* Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc.
* Experience deploying at least one application that other people use
* Have held at least one engineering position post-education
* Initiative, curiosity, a bias for action, and a problem-solving attitude
We expect all Truss engineers to consistently develop new skills, and cross-train into new disciplines outside of their current areas of expertise.

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Fort Belvoir, Quantico, Washington D.C., or Reston:

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

These roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support. We're currently looking for folks in a number of US cities as well as Belgium, Canada, DACH region (Germany, Austria Switzerland), France, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Magic | Full Remote Job | Full-time | Full-stack | Software Engineering
ABOUT THE COMPANY:

Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.

ABOUT THE POSITION:

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

ABOUT WORKING REMOTE:

This position is full remote and you can live wherever you want, or travel while you work with us. As our team is distributed across several time zones, compatibility with both UTC-7/8 and UTC+8 is helpful and willingness to participate in team meetings at non-standard times for 5-10 hours per week is ideal.

Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.

Bonus points if you've got...
- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins
- Experience within early-stage startups, remote, or human operations companiesApply here: https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hnr

Recursion Pharmaceuticals | Salt Lake City, Utah | Onsite, Full-Time | www.recursionpharma.com/careers
Take a glimpse at the industry's largest biological images dataset which we released June 28th to be used as part of the NeurIPS 2019 competition track. Generated entirely in-house at  Recursion, for the development of new ML algorithms for drug discovery.

https://www.rxrx.ai/

We have raised over $200M to apply machine learning to one of the most unique datasets in existence - over 12 billion images of cells under a huge number of biological and chemical perturbations, generated in our own labs - in order to find treatments for hundreds of diseases. Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies. Among other awesome folks, Yoshua Bengio is one of our advisors, and helps our ML team come up with novel ways of tackling these problems.
We’re looking for:
* Data Scientists: Looking for experienced Data Scientists both for our Innovation and Assay Development as well as Image Analysis and Quality teams. You’ll work with our data, biology , high throughput screening (HTS), and engineering teams to identify and answer questions in high-dimensional data.
* Data Engineer: Looking for a strong Software Engineer who thinks critically and uses data to measure results. Great opportunity for experienced engineers interested in coding for a meaningful purpose and a massive human impact.

* ML Researcher: Looking for a highly experienced senior/principal-level Machine Learning Researcher who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.

* ML Engineer: Looking for experienced Machine Learning Engineer who values experimentation and the rigorous use of the scientific method, high collaboration across multiple functions, and intense curiosity driving them to keep our systems cutting edge.

Additional role we are hiring for:
* Biologist, Computational Chemists, Automation Engineer, and Drug Discovery experts.

Logistics: Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiking/running/biking is literally out our back door, and it's half an hour to 6 ski resorts. Great pay, health insurance, 401k, relocation assistance (onsite is required), equity, fully-paid gym membership, complementary chef-prepared meals everyday, two one-week paid company closures in addition to flexible, generous vacation, 70ft onsite rock climbing wall, commuter benefits,  a top-caliber team, and help make a massively positive impact. Happy to sponsor/extend visas, but you need to already be authorized to work in the US--we can’t handle the lottery at this stage.
Tech: 
Data Science: pydata stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, bokeh, tensorflow w/keras, etc), a cluster of GPUs for all your research ideas
Software Engineering: python, clojure[script], javascript, go, react.js, kafka, kubernetes (GKE), GCE, AWS

I had a bad experience interviewing here. After a 4 hour onsite I was sent an email several business days later with "we decided that we will not be moving forward" and no feedback. Hopefully they have improved the process since then. I have found other companies give some amount of feedback, even big corporations, so I can't imagine it's a liability thing, but maybe...

wouldn't recommend working with this guy.
I was an early consumer of the service and I gave him a great suggestion of simplifying the form to make it easier and he flipped out, cursed me and deleted my account. This guy's a loose cannon.

This is free security advice, have separate accounts for various public and private facing communications channels.By saying “your DM might get buried under the avalanche of work-related DMs by Monday” indicates an interesting combination of awareness and a lack of awareness that I find both baffling and too common.
