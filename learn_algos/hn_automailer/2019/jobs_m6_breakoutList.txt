Take a glimpse at the industry's largest biological images dataset which we released June 28th to be used as part of the NeurIPS 2019 competition track. Generated entirely in-house at  Recursion, for the development of new ML algorithms for drug discovery.

https://www.rxrx.ai/

We have raised over $80M to apply machine learning to one of the most unique datasets in existence - over 12 billion images of cells under a huge number of biological and chemical perturbations, generated in our own labs - in order to find treatments for hundreds of diseases. Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies. Among other awesome folks, Yoshua Bengio is one of our advisors, and helps our ML team come up with novel ways of tackling these problems.

We’re looking for:

* Data Scientists: Looking for experienced Data Scientists both for our Innovation and Assay Development as well as Image Analysis and Quality teams. You’ll work with our data, biology , high throughput screening (HTS), and engineering teams to identify and answer questions in high-dimensional data.

* Data Engineer: Looking for a strong Software Engineer who thinks critically and uses data to measure results. Great opportunity for experienced engineers interested in coding for a meaningful purpose and a massive human impact.

* ML Researcher: Looking for a highly experienced senior/principal-level Machine Learning Researcher who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.

* ML Engineer: Looking for experienced Machine Learning Engineer who values experimentation and the rigorous use of the scientific method, high collaboration across multiple functions, and intense curiosity driving them to keep our systems cutting edge.
Additional roles we are hiring for: 
* Biologist, Computational Chemists, Automation Engineer, and Drug Discovery experts.
