Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only, select roles only)| $80k-$170k https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.
We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Persona | Designer | Remote | Full-time | $70k-$110k
About Persona

As a new parent, you realize with clarity that time is fleeting. When your parent is diagnosed with Parkinson's, you realize with clarity that life is short. You realize that your most important memories are just sitting in your fallible mind. Our memories are one of our most important possessions, yet we don't use a dedicated tool to help us relive our family's love.

In the future, you'll have your precious memories at your fingertips. Whenever you need them, wherever you are, stored securely forever. We'll share these memories with the people closest to us & keep these precious memories within quick reach for us personally. We'll take a few minutes here and there to reminisce through our memories. Escape. Relive our family's love: our children's laughter, our spouse's wedding day smile, our parent's "it'll be okay". It will all be there, in one spot: deep & meaningful.

To bring this to reality we need to do a few things: We need to make collecting memories fun, make curating delightful with collaboration, & build magical relive experiences. We're building a platform that starts by focusing on Millennial parents, with the intention of bringing along the Gen X grandparents for the social network Facebook should have been: a private family room instead of a public town square. Focused on love & family, not memes & politics.

About the Role

We're looking for our 1st hire, a designer to help us set our design foundation. We're a team of 3 (engineering, iOS, & product).

Role Requirements:

- Beautiful modern design sense

- Positive attitude

- Growth mindset

- Loves working remote

Ideal Candidate:

- Mother

- Willing to help in other areas of the business

- Illustration animation experience

- Sketch experience

This project is being worked on by experienced startup founders (2 startups: 1st acquired, 2nd funded $20m).

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Leads | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa are solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa's team members have worked at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

We are 100% aligned with creators and aim to help them succeed by creating a business around what they love to do.

We are looking for a Lead Software Engineer to be one of the early members of our team. This is an opportunity to help build Glow from its earliest days. The role is mostly individual contributor work (technical vision, design, writing code), with some time mentoring 2-3 other engineers on the team.

We promise that you'll never be bored, that you'll be trusted to manage your own time, and that you'll be working on something that makes a difference in the lives of content creators and their fans. Also, we offer a competitive salary, full medical/dental benefits, and unlimited podcasts.

Does the following sound like you? You love podcasts. You are excited about helping creators thrive and build a living around their content. You have strong customer empathy and a track record of building customer-facing products. You work iteratively, shipping often and measuring results. You enjoy a small team where bureaucracy is low but great communication and collaboration is essential. You don’t get hung up on the boundaries of front-end, back-end, dev ops – you do whatever it takes to deliver. You think in terms of architecture and love to stitch together all elements of the software lifecycle to deliver great software. You thrive in the ambiguity and activity of a startup environment.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

We're working towards a future where ML is as helpful for open-ended questions like “Should I get this medical procedure?” and “What career is right for me” as it is for optimizing ad click-through rates.

The core pillar of our research is Mosaic, an app for decomposing thinking about hard questions into small subtasks. We compositionally build complex thoughts out of simple pieces. We want to get to the point where automated aggregation of individual thoughts leads to something that is more than the sum of the pieces.

Humboldt talked about natural language as a system that "makes infinite use of finite means" -- an infinite number of sentences can be created using a finite number of grammatical rules. As engineering team lead at Ought, you're working on mechanisms that have similar flexible compositionality.

WHAT IS INTERCOM? 
Intercom is the world’s #1 business messenger and more.
Whether our customers want to do more with less by leaning on our 100+ apps, we help out  customers’ customers self serve with articles and chat bots, or target chat to specific segments Intercom is customer messaging that fits their business. Intercom is also the best team inbox for sales and support AND the leading choice for targeted outbound messages that deliver.

In our 8 year history, we’ve built world class sales, marketing and R&D functions, and published a number of books along the way (https://www.intercom.com/books).
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK FOR INTERCOM?
Our culture is open and friendly and inclusive - and this is something we are proud of. We are optimistic, passionate and positive. We like people who can stay focused and work hard and who are confident, yet kind and humble. We like to experiment, sometimes inventing things for the first time, but we stay pragmatic, starting small and simple in everything we do. We love people who genuinely want to learn and grow and take bets on high potential engineers on rapid trajectories.
We’re opinionated by default, for example we run LESS software (https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/) and ship continuously (https://www.intercom.com/blog/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/). We’re technically conservative and like to keep it simple (https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/build-boring-software/), but where it means building better products we’ll double down on new technology like machine learning (https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-fergal-reid-ai-machine-learning/) in a pragmatic way.

TECH: Ruby on Rails application with an Ember.js frontend. We use MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon’s DynamoDB for most of our storage. Our web messenger is built on React.
