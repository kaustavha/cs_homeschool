Hey HN! We're hiring engineers for a low-level systems programming/reverse engineering role. More deets here: https://discordapp.com/jobs/4200751002

Notably absent from the list of requirements is professional work experience or a college degree. If you're a self-taught programmer passionate about this kind of work, please apply!

As someone who got their first "real" job from a Who's Hiring thread (this one, actually: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1958374) I'm super excited to be able to offer the same kind of opportunity to people who might be having a hard time getting through resume filters due to their unusual background.

Feel free to apply through the website (I personally look at every submission), but if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at cmFtc2V5QGRpc2NvcmRhcHAuY29t or on Discord at cmFtc2V5IzAwMDE=. Happy to give career advice or answer any questions you might have, even if you don't think you're a good fit for the role.
We're also hiring for a bunch of other stuff, but I'm not the hiring manager for those teams. If low-level/systems programming isn't your cup of tea, check out the rest of our openings here: https://discordapp.com/jobs

ABL Space Systems | Full-stack Software Engineer | Los Angeles, CA | Full-time | Onsite
ABL Space Systems was founded in 2017 by SpaceX veterans to build the world's best small launch vehicle. Our first rocket, the RS1, will be a highly-capable, cost-effective vehicle for placing small satellites into orbit. We are looking for experienced software engineers to help us build out the information systems that serve as the technological foundation for critical operations across the company.
Our in-house software team currently has one member (that's me), so this is an opportunity to have a huge impact as the company works toward the first launch next year.  We are builing a comprehensive set of tools that facilitate engineering design, factory build operations, test campaigns, inventory management, full part traceability, supply chain oversight, part procurement, and launch site procedures – to name a few. 
It's not every day that a web application helps launch stuff into space! I personally find it very rewarding to wake up each morning and contribute to this exciting mission and push humanity a tiny bit further out into the cosmos.
The backend is a python Flask app, and our frontend is written with React + Mobx. Experience in those technologies is not required, but we are looking for engineers comfortable across the stack and who proactively seek out and learn what is required to solve the problem at hand.
If this sounds interesting at all, please reach out. I would love to talk. My e-mail: waltrip@ablspacesystems.com

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.

If you are someone with an engineering background and a bunch of hobby projects cluttering your home, drop us a line! We are especially interested in individuals with hands-on experience with unmanned aircraft, robotics, multi-agent path planning, remote sensing, and rapid prototyping.

But you don't necessarily need to be an expert in drones! We have are a ton of projects around asset management, project planning, distributed logs/metric collection/analysis, and human-centric design (the UX of the ground control software, for instance).

Our hiring process involves a short take-home work sample test, reviewing work you have done, and reviewing our stuff. We want creative, thoughtful, empathetic people with serious grit to join a team dedicated to inclusivity and an important mission.

still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).
Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Xamarin developer: C# experience as a minimum, F# desirable (we can also mentor you on the transition from C# to F#), interested/knowledgeable in Rust is another plus.

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or zkSNARKs.

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 6months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a managerial/lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)

Rokt (www.rokt.com) | Software Engineer (Clojure) | Sydney, Australia | Full-time, ONSITE
Rokt is hiring thoughtful, talented functional programmers to expand our Clojure team in Sydney. Ideally we're looking for mid- to senior-level engineers, but get in touch even if that doesn't describe you: above all, we're looking for great people, not "X years in the job already".

Rokt is a successful startup (150+ employees, profitable for several years now) with a transaction marketing platform used by some of the world's largest ecommerce sites. Our Sydney-based engineering team supports a business that is growing rapidly around the world. We have a small handful of applications and services in Clojure, including some of our most critical work.

If you have professional Clojure experience, great. What we're really looking for, though, is developers comfortable with a simple, functional style of writing code -- we'll happily bring you up to speed on Clojure if you're not there already. If you have a Java background and you're looking to move in a more FP direction, we'd love to talk to you. If you're a Lisper or Haskeller, or have a background in another FP language, we'd love to talk to you.

Contact me at sam@rokt.com
Please note that unfortunately at this point we can only consider applicants who already have a legal right to work in Australia.

Portchain | Copenhagen, Denmark | Full time | REMOTE | Front-end and full stack Software Engineers
We're hiring two full stack or front-end developers (NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL, Python) to join our team of 4 remote developers (incl. the engineering manager onsite in Copenhagen).

Experience working remotely. Minimum 4 years of professional software engineering experience.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age.

Doctype | Software engineer with reverse engineering skills / Anti-cheat engineer | Stockholm, Sweden | ONSITE, VISA or REMOTE (worldwide) | Full-time / part-time | https://www.doctype.se/
We're a small digital agency based in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently around 15 people. We have an office in the heart of Stockholm, but our employees are free to work from wherever they feel most productive. We've built https://lemondogs.com/, https://www.gothiaecup.com/, https://beta.esportal.se/, amongst other websites. Our largest clients are within the eSports segment.

We’re currently looking for a software engineer with reverse engineering skills to work with us on client-sided anti-cheat technology. Our current tech stack is mainly Go, MariaDB and React, but the project you would be working on is a standalone client built in C/C++ and Assembly.

Requirements:

* Good understanding of C and x86-64 assembly

* Good understanding of the x86 architecture

* Basic understanding of the Windows NT kernel

* Eager to learn

Nice to have:

* Experience with reverse engineering malware/cheats

* Experience with reverse engineering the Windows NT kernel

* Experience with binary instrumentation

* Experience with hardware-assisted virtualization (such as VT-x and AMD-V)

* Experience with SLAT (Second Level Address Translation)

* Understanding cryptography primitives
The role we’re looking to fill is initially part-time, but may eventually grow into a full-time role. You’ll be working together with another anti-cheat engineer to combat cheaters in video games. If you’re looking for a full-time role, we may be able to offer that depending on your breadth of knowledge. We can offer relocation to Sweden and assist with housing. I’m one of the co-founders and currently hold the role as CTO. Feel free to mail me at mark@doctype.se if this sounds interesting to you!

QuotaPath | Backend, Frontend or Full-stack Engineer | Philadelphia, PA or Austin, TX | $70K to $150K DOE | Full-Time | On-Site | https://www.quotapath.com/careers/
Happy new year, y’all!
Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.

We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 9 people: 3 engineers, 1 UX and 4 others. I’m one of those 4 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!

Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.

Secfi | Software engineer(s) | Amsterdam, the Netherlands | EUR 35-70k + equity
We're on a mission to increase employee’s private company ownership by helping them exercise their options - a complex and opaque process that typically comes with a lot of anxiety and unanswered questions. Our tools help you fully understand your stock options’ value and maximize their potential.

For example: one of the most complicated things for employees is figuring out how much taxes they need to pay when exercising their Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options. The tax planning tool inside our dashboard does just that: https://www.secfi.com/#gif-container

Complex challenges we’re working on next include: multiyear tax forecast analysis, recommendation engine based on various sources and fantastic UX and UI.

Things have been going very well here at Secfi, and consequently in 2019 we aspire to grow the team 3x.

We’re looking for ten software engineers and two product managers to join us: https://www.secfi.com/careers

PingCAP | Software Engineer, Customer Success | San Mateo and distributed | Full-Time | Remote | https://angel.co/pingcap-1/jobs
We make TiDB, an open source scale-out database that is consistent, always online, and MySQL compatible. Our underlying distributed key-value layer, TiKV, is a CNCF project.

We have a lot of interesting challenges to keep scaling for our existing users with 100+ TB of data and expanding to help users in new ways with their database needs.

I am part of the international team based out of San Mateo (bay area). Our small team is oriented to being remote, and we travel periodically to meet in person.

Our tech stack is Rust, Go, Kubernetes, and TiDB itself! You can work on a serverless cloud service, do low-level database hacking, or work directly with customers depending on your existing experience.

I like working on TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a skilled team. On a daily basis I learn new things about databases and the cloud, but I also get to apply my existing experiences to have a big impact.
See the jobs link for more details and compensation.

Old Reliable | Software Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE (UK)
Old Reliable is a remote-first software consultancy & development house based in the UK. We’re a young, ambitious company but we’re focussed more on having a sustainable work-life balance than on slaving away until midnight 6 (or 7!) days a week.

We offer flexible working in a laid-back environment. You’ll manage yourself and be responsible for the delivery of a project from start to finish. You’ll need to be open to learning & applying new technologies. You’ll probably be working on a new project every few months.

At this point we’re not asking for a specific skillset. The projects we’ll be able to take on in the future will depend on your abilities and interests. To date we’ve worked on C/C++ and build systems (cmake, assorted CI systems, conda-forge) so if you have experience in the area, that would be a plus.

We are strongly against the idea that remote workers should earn more or less money depending on where they live. The value you add to a company doesn’t depend on your cost of living. If you want to earn a London salary without having to live in London, let’s talk.

Alice Technologies | Software Engineers, Senior Software Engineers, Full Stack Engineers | Menlo Park, CA | Onsite | http://alicetechnologies.com/
We at Alice are currently in the forefront of scheduling for building structures. The problem we made personal was the inefficiency (and lack of technological improvement) in the construction industry and we aim to solve it by introducing high tech, AI scheduling software to aid in planning and constructing real world projects. We think this is a great problem to solve because no other tech like ours exists. Where most other companies in this space focus on reporting, or task management, we tackle one of the hardest parts, the scheduling itself.

Our space lends us to have to solve many interesting problems from optimization, to modern ux flow, to graph theory, to fault tolerant services. We are currently seeded with a total of 3M funding and are striving to make our series A round. And we'd be happy to have more people on board before dilution :).

Onzin Incorporated - San Francisco, California, USA [REMOTE]
Greetings! We are a small business in the US looking to hire a backend or DevOps engineer to work remotely with our team full or part time. The team is several engineers already, and you would be joining them in supporting our ongoing internal and external projects by helping to set up and provision backend systems and services, as well as some light application programming like API servers.

Our work is a combination of in-house projects with external client engagements filling in the gaps. For this role we would be looking for deep experience with back-end and infrastructure technologies like Amazon AWS or Google GCP, provisioning tools like Ansible / Puppet / Salt, Python development, shell scripting, Linux system administration, docker and containerization technologies, build and deploy servers, CloudFormation and Terraform for infrastructure management, as well as some basic networking skills. There will also be tasks involving setting up backend components like databases, job queues, and micro-services.

This is a great role for mid or senior level engineers who are looking for flexibility and some independence in how their work gets completed. Do note that while we are excited to be growing our business and adding a new position this year, we will likely remain a small team for the foreseeable future. We are also not a traditional ‘product’ company, and most of our time is spent on smaller applications and projects that eventually reach completion.
If you would like to know more, send a message to hiring@onzininc.com with your questions. To apply, please send a resume and few remarks about your background and technical experience to the same address. Thank you for reading, and good luck out there!

Brava Home | Full Time | Mobile & Web Software Engineers | Redwood City CA | Onsite | https://www.brava.com
At Brava we want to help you make food at home faster, easier, and tastier than you do today. Our oven takes the stress out of cooking with hundreds of presets to automatically cook anything from Salmon with Broccolini and Tomatoes to Hot Pockets. It does this using directed energy from infrared lamps separating the oven into three distinct zones. This allows us to cook multiple foods differently, but at the same time, by controlling the power to each zone with software. Various sensors in the oven provide the algorithms with feedback.

The oven took over three years to develop and is on the market. Customers love it. We are now heavily investing in mobile and web products to complement our great product and fuel our growth.

Join our user experience focused software team and work with world class engineers, product managers, and designers. Current needs are in react-native, responsive web, and nodejs. Looking for flexible engineers that love to build great customer experiences.

We offer competitive benefits, equity, and free lunch. As a bonus the R&D kitchen is steps away and they bring out amazing food all day long.

If you love food, it's worth a chat. On site interviews get a high class lunch on us made in the Brava. :)

Cooltrax | Senior Engineers | Melbourne, AUSTRALIA | ONSITE but flexible
Cooltrax builds IoT hardware and software to monitor temperatures, control fridges, and track trailers as they transport goods across the country. That might sound simple, but Australians alone buy $120bn of groceries each year and our services provide an increasingly critical piece of the supply chain infrastructure that makes this possible. We operate in Australia and the United States and have a small engineering team with their home base in Melbourne.

We run a global real-time temperature monitoring system covering some of the largest supply chain partners in the world, where you will face daily challenges and demanding timelines that will be your problems to solve. But we’ll give you the autonomy to choose the right solutions, the flexibility to work in the way that suits you (working from home or abroad is possible, some of the time), and the support to handle everything a rapid-paced start-up environment can throw at you. Most of our front-end and back-end software is in JavaScript (or increasingly TypeScript), we’re moving from an Ember.js application to React, our firmware is in C/C++, and our infrastructure is defined in code and orchestrated with Kubernetes. Other technology keywords we use include: MySQL, CouchDB, GraphQL, Redis, node.js, Azure, git, and Jira.
For a more thorough position description, or just to have a chat about the sorts of projects we have here, please contact me at: tom.allen@cooltrax.com. I'm the Engineering Manager here and I'm passionate about building a workplace culture that supports high performance engineering. We have our fair share of problems and legacy software to deal with, but there's abundant opportunity for interesting greenfields work too, with a board ready and willing to invest in new areas of the business.

Overview: Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception of flavor, aroma, and texture to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products, enter new markets, and optimize their existing brands. We're a diverse 12 person post Series-A startup.

Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, Java, GraphQL, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS

The Position(s)
_Data Science_: We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention ��� we built a data science team to build our product. Our Data Science team develops new models and algorithms from scratch to make second-order inference on sparse data sets from non-representative samples that generalizes to the underlying target population. We rely on cutting edge models such as persistent homology, PU Learning, and metric learning to make predictions on non-eucldian human sensory data. We don't use tensor flow or pandas or keras as they are not a good fit for our problem space. We prefer a deep understanding of math and stats VS experience running logistic regressions in Python. 
(but we're cool with Python / Logit / experience)
_Engineering_: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Data-Engineers with experiance in micro-batch processing for machine learning pipelines.
Next Steps: please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+2 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly. (P.S. I'm on holiday, so it will be at least a week before I reply)

Datto | Sr. Software Engineer | Boston, MA / Norwalk, CT / Rochester, NY | ONSITE
Datto provides data protection, business continuity, networking, business management, and file backup and sync products.

Description: The Core Products Team maintains and develops new features for all of Datto’s backup appliances (SIRIS, Alto). In a nutshell, the backup appliance is a physical (or virtual) appliance that takes block-level backups of Windows, Mac, and Linux machines turn them into raw disk images and stores them on a local ZFS-based disk array. In the case of a disaster, our customers can then restore these backups/disk image instantly as KVM-based virtual machines, iSCSI targets, Samba shares, and many other formats. We also offer a virtual VMware/Hyper-V-based appliance and integrate with their hypervisors. We write code in modern Symfony-based PHP (with some Python and C sprinkled in), but we strongly rely on our Ubuntu-based Linux stack. Our appliance has a web UI (much like a router), but the main magic happens in the backend services and processes. We do amazing and exciting things every day, such as detecting when a VM has booted successfully, injecting drivers into the Windows registry before boot, or generating vmdk files on the fly. [More about the job on the website (see below)].

Responsibilities: You’ll work in one of our three Scrum teams, developing our SIRIS and Alto product. Each team consists of about five engineers. Work hours are usually around 9-5, though we're pretty flexible with that. Working from home is also possible, although not encouraged.

Qualifications: We're looking for a senior engineer with deep Linux know how -- ideally with knowledge in virtualization (VMware ESX, Hyper-V, libvirt, KVM/QEMU), software defined networking and file systems (such as ZFS and Ceph).

Details see https://www.datto.com/careers/job-board/post/1524107

We're an Oakland-based startup with a mission to bring trust, transparency, and ease to one of life's most stressful experiences - moving. Much of this industry still runs on pen and paper. We're changing that, and in the process, building a superior consumer-side experience as well.

We're growing fast. Just this past year, more than 11,000 moves across more than a dozen states were managed through our platform. To keep up with demand for our service, we'd like to bring a Senior Engineer on who can help us take the product to the next level.

You'll work with experienced Sales and Product leaders at an early stage startup that has a proven business model. We're also proud of the fact that 60% of our leadership team is female.
OUR STACK: Rails, React, React Native, Postgres.

INTERVIEW PROCESS: A bit about our interview process for senior engineers, which I think is different from many others, and a lot more real! See https://twitter.com/vinthanedar/status/991149057555906560

APPLY: I'm one of the co-founders. Reach out to me at vineet[at]oncue dot co if you're interested.

Personal | Software Developer Apprentice | New York, NY | REMOTE / FULL TIME / INTERNS | https://airtable.com/shr7Gxoh0jDu3Dwr8
I'm hiring a Software Developer Apprentice, full-time and paid.

There will be an emphasis on learning and quality, not speed of development. You'll work on: frontend and backend web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, and APIs.

=============================

Software Developer Apprentice

This is an excellent opportunity for an aspiring software developer who is eager to learn by doing.

Details:

The position is full-time and paid. Day to day work will be remote, but candidates may prefer to relocate to New York City temporarily for in person mentorship and learning opportunities.

In this position you will be tasked with a variety of software development projects spanning the entire stack using the following technologies:

* Web frontend: React

* Web backend: Ruby on Rails

* Mobile: iOS with Swift

* Desktop: Cross platform with Electron

* Platform: REST and GraphQL APIs

You will work on real projects and receive mentorship on software development and industry best practices. There will be a strong emphasis on producing quality work and becoming a great developer and less of an emphasis on speed of development.

This is not a typical job at a company. It's a paid full time apprenticeship opportunity working with John Britton in an individual capacity.

Qualifications:

This is an apprenticeship: zero professional experience is required. Candidates must, however, have demonstrated determination and an unwavering desire to learn. Acceptable evidence may include: completed coursework, self study records, side projects, and personal recommendations.
Apply: https://airtable.com/shr7Gxoh0jDu3Dwr8

OpenMessage | Platform, Analytics & Dev Tools Engineer | https://openmessage.io | NYC | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE in North America, EST timezone | $80-$120k + 0.1-2%
Hey fellow engineers and future colleagues,

We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services.

It's also pretty awesome that goal-oriented conversations are like conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our decision making so there is a lot of impactful work to do.

We are starting to share our API with other companies and need to create a great developer experience for them. This new role will get to own the open source SDK and client libraries, CLIs, documentation, key management etc. Same goes for logging, BI, and infrastructure for the developer ecosystem.

Our main tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. We prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles over cleverness and magic.

We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy. No jerks allowed, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!

There is a small take-home project that covers basic data transformation and schema design. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding exercises. Open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.

We will have an interview to go over implementation choices, ideas, and discuss technology. Then we do a couple with other team members to cover general topics like management philosophy, industry and market perspectives, intellectual motivations, professional development trajectory, office environment, interpersonal style etc.
Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!

Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | Full-time | https://www.thanx.com/careers/job/1466586/Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing with the same message to everyone. The result is an ever-increasing wave of generic spam that makes it hard for consumers to build deeper, data-driven relationships with their favorite brands. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.
In a nutshell, Thanx ingests data, provides insights, enables actions to drive growth in the business. As a platform, Thanx is a horizontally-scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency system.
Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital), to name a few.Thanx Engineering
Yes, we have an app you can download. But that represents no more than 5% of our codebase. The power of Thanx is massively scalable data pipelines, microservices that power four 9s uptime, intelligent purchase normalization, and matching algorithms  — we don’t show that stuff off publicly.Here’s more on who we are:
 • Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from startups and successful product companies like Google, Facebook, Intuit, Disney. This is an elite Eng team, period.
 • Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform.
 • Tech: scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency backend systems; beautiful, performant, responsive UIs; user-friendly mobile apps.
 • Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing, and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours. We work and play hard. Be warned! when it comes to Mario Kart, we are super competitive!

Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineers; Product Managers; Data Scientists | San Francisco, CA | Onsite
The mission of Academia.edu is to accelerate the world’s research. To accelerate the pace of discovery. Academia.edu is building a new communications system for the dissemination and peer review of academic research.

We believe that there are some inefficiencies in academic publishing today. We believe that by shifting to an internet-first dissemination system, academic publishing can be made faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

Over 20 million papers have been uploaded to Academia.edu, out of 100 million papers ever written. About 40 million people visit Academia.edu each month to access academic research. Academia.edu became profitable in 2017 off of a premium business model.

Here are some of the priorities at Academia.edu:

- Open access: we want every paper ever written to be on the internet, available for free

- Distribution system: for any given upload, it could be distributed to any one of Academia.edu's 72 million registered users. The goal of the distribution system is to enable a paper be distributed to the right subset of people. We want that subset to see that paper in their News Feed and think “Wow, I really want to read that.”

- Multi-platform: we started out on Web, and we are in the process of releasing an iOS app. After the iOS app, we will release an Android app.

- Peer review: as papers are distributed through the Academia.edu graph, academics share their opinions about those papers, and those opinions aggregate over time.

We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."

We are looking to hire full stack software engineers, iOS engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.
If you are interested to learn more, please email the CEO, Richard Price, at richard [at] academia.edu

MIG Global | Cambridge, UK | Software engineers/developers, full stack preferred - any level of experience | UX Designers <= 3 years experience | REMOTE or ONSITE (flexible) | VISA
MIG Global is a technology-led market research insight company. We use our tech to automate and enable, and aim to deliver relevant data and insight to our clients much more quickly than our competitors are able. We feel there's a window of opportunity open to us to disrupt the market research industry which is, in many ways, quite slow moving and traditional.

Our tech team comprises 15 people, mostly developers, along with two UX designers. I wouldn't go so far as to say based at, but we're centred on The Bradfield Centre in Cambridge, UK. However, most of our team work from home at least some of the time, and we have three substantially remote members. We've become quite proficient at working whilst spread out geographically so we're quite open to full-time remote workers as well. On top of this we also offer a 35 hour work week and flexible working hours.

Our stack is SQL Server, C#/.NET, TypeScript and React for all new systems over the past 18 months and going forward. We have various technologies in our legacy codebase, including JQuery, Angular, MVC and - in our desktop tools - CEF, WPF and WinForms (sorry!). The upcoming year will see something of a sea change with increasing using of R and Python, along with the latter's ecosystem of statistical, data mining, NLP, and ML libraries and integrations.

We are hiring at least half a dozen talented software engineers at all levels of experience to join us. We're also looking for a couple of user experience designers with up to 3 years experience who our senior designers can mentor and develop. Regardless of our role, you’ll be working on our end to end market research, data, and insight delivery platform.

We are happy to pursue sponsorship for the right candidates looking to relocate to the UK.

TO APPLY:
Software Developers - https://migglobal.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/view.php?id=3
UX Designers - https://migglobal.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/view.php?id=6

Spring Discovery | Software Engineer + Data Scientists / Applied ML | Full-Time | SF Bay Area | ONSITE
Spring Discovery is applying machine learning to accelerate the discovery of therapies for aging and its many related diseases. Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases — by understanding and treating the biological damage accumulated as we age, we can find powerful new therapies for fighting disease and living healthier, longer lives.

Over the past few decades, an unignorable amount of evidence has piled up from the best labs in the world showing that this is possible [1]. However, the research, while promising, has been frustratingly slow. We’re leveraging the power of machine learning to dramatically improve the experimental process and we believe this approach has the potential to unlock a whole new class of therapeutic discoveries.

We have deep support from top-notch investors, including General Catalyst, First Round, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Felicis, Caffeinated Capital, Sam Altman, and more [2]. And our advisory board includes both world leaders in aging research and senior pharma execs.

We have a great early team of senior engineers (ex-Google, Khan Academy, CZI) collaborating tightly with leading scientists in the field. But we need help to continue scaling out our ML analysis platform and our automated lab. We’re looking for experienced software engineers and data scientists/ML researchers who would enjoy working on things ranging from data infrastructure to modelling to statistical analysis of large datasets to building an internal web app for tracking lab data. Yes, you belong even if you don't have a bio background — we're a cross-functional team. (Although of course biology experience is a plus).

If this sounds interesting to you, head on over to https://www.springdisc.com/careers or email me directly at benkomalo+hn@springdisc.com.

As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Common Networks | San Francisco | Full-Time, Onsite | https://common.net
Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

Series-B Company, with $35M total funding lead by General Catalyst and Eclipse.

Kettlebell Kitchen | https://www.kettlebellkitchen.com | New York, NY | Senior Software Engineer | ONSITE | Full-time
We are looking for quick learners who enjoy working with modern software development tools in the food and manufacturing space.

Knowledge of specific frameworks or libraries is less important than a broad knowledge of software development practices and an ability to learn.

At Kettlebell Kitchen, we're building technology to empower and drive our food manufacturing business. We believe in tried and true business models, like buying raw materials and selling a value-added product. Explosive growth is nice, but not at any cost.

There are a ton of areas, including much of the ordering platform, that need re-thinking.

Must haves:

1. Significant experience developing web applications and web sites.

2. Very good grasp of Python 3.5+ or TypeScript. Both are a plus.

3. Some knowledge of the other language listed above.

4. Willingness to work with both ecosystems.

5. Relational database experience, ideally PostgreSQL and MySQL.

6. Knowledge of automated testing - including how much and when to use it.

7. Clear, concise coding skills. Your code is more often described as "clean and elegant" than "clever."

Nice to haves:

1. Understanding of formal methods

2. Bash and vi fu.

3. Mypy and static typing experience in Python.

4. React experience.

5. Django experience.

6. LoopBack experience.

7. Angular experience.

8. Static typing experience in other languages: Java, C++

9. API design

10. Rust experience

11. A love of healthy food or fitness. Or both.

PathAI | Boston, MA or Austin, TX | https://pathai.com | Onsite / Remote (US)
PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to help detect cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. A few days ago, I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.
Check out our open positions at https://www.pathai.com/careers/.

Bitcraft is a young company based in Tokyo, specialized in developing backend solutions for console and mobile video games.

We also support our clients on the frontend development of games using common game engines such as Unity3D or Unreal, as well as the creation of web-based administration tools.

== Positions ==

We are looking for an enthusiastic and passionate developer to join our team.

Since technologies quickly evolve, we need someone motivated to keep up with the flow and who is interested in learning new frameworks when something exciting comes up.

We have server-oriented positions as well as client-side development positions.

We offer you the opportunity to become a key member of our team with great potential for career evolution.

Let's talk about what you want to do, or what you want to learn, and see what is the best fit.

Speaking Japanese is not a requirement.

We also have a pretty awesome rooftop terrasse (see pictures on our website) on which we like enjoy lunch and refreshing after-work beers.

== Projects ==

Just to give you an idea of the kind of project we work on, we completed the development of Final Fantasy Explorers Force ( http://www.ffexforce.jp ), a multi-player RPG game on smartphone.

Bitcraft was in charge of the entire backend development as well as the conception of administration and deployment tools required in production.

The game is only available in Japan at the moment.

Indigo Agriculture | Senior GraphQL API Engineer, Senior React Engineer | Boston, MA | ONSITE | Full-time |
Our mission is to improve farmer profitability while pulling chemicals out of our food supply and making healthier food in the process.  You can read about Indigo's mission here: https://www.indigoag.com/about

More specifically for these roles: my team is building a Marketplace (https://www.indigoag.com/indigo-marketplace) where farmers can sell their crops direct to buyers without having to go through a middle-man, who historically takes a good part of the profits and disincentivizes the farmer from producing high-quality, sustainable crops since they all get mixed together.  In Indigo's Marketplace, farmers that product premium crops (Non-gmo, Organic, low toxins) get a premium price.  We're essentially building a market like the Nasdaq, but with many more dimensions (different crops, quality, selling windows), with heavy geographic components (buyers and sellers need to be close) and a bunch of different pricing options (hedging, futures, etc...), so there is no shortage of fun, complex problems to solve.

We use React, TypeScript and Apollo (GraphQL) on the front end and Node, TypeScript and GraphQL on the back end.  The combination of TypeScript on both the front and back ends and GraphQL in the middle allows us to be type-safe from the DB all the way to the web page where the data is bound.  We're been GraphQL since day one and are huge fans.

Please reach out to me directly at dcaddigan@indigoag.com or apply directly via the links below.  If you apply directly, write a note saying you're coming from Hacker News.

* Senior GraphQL API Engineer - https://boards.greenhouse.io/indigo/jobs/659135

* Senior React Engineer - https://boards.greenhouse.io/indigo/jobs/666210
Also note that we have some remote contractors and our processes are set up to handle full-time remote folks, we just haven't pulled the trigger on the right person yet.  If you'd need to be remote full-time and think you're a great match for the position, please reach out!

Lumiata | Onsite | San Mateo | Software Engineer - Data Platform, Principal Software Engineer - Data Platform, Senior Software Engineer - Web Platform
We're a medical technology company using machine learning and massive amounts of patient data to improve how the healthcare system works. Our tools process millions of patient records to predict what kinds of medical risk and problems will befall a patient and other medically relevant parameters. Join us to learn about the many intricacies of medical data, how to handle very large volumes of patient records, and how to build pipelines to operationalize cutting-edge machine learning models. We have developed a product major healthcare players want to buy and now need to turn it into something big that will streamline how healthcare works, come help us build it out!

Principal/Software Engineer Data: We work mostly in Python and Scala. Main technologies include Spark, TensorFlow, Airflow and Hadoop among others. We’re always trying new things, and you will be part of making those decisions. We’re looking to build more robust pipelines to transform raw, often human-entered data into standards-compliant forms, and to deploy a wide variety of machine learning/AI models in a scalable, traceable manner.

Senior Software Engineer Web: We are building out a web platform for clients to connect to our platform. This will be a clean-sheet ground-up build and we are looking for someone who can lead that project. Eventually we will hire more for this area, right now we’re looking for the first engineer to lay the groundwork and build initial prototypes.

We need several engineers at 2-3 year and at senior/tech lead level. Requirements for more senior positions shift more toward demonstrated ability to architect and lead projects. In all cases though we look for independence, a strong sense of craft, and solid technical skills.

General Process (based on candidate we make small tweaks):

1.) Phone screen for resume

2.) Short take-home problem

3.) Phone conversation about take-home

4.) Onsite with us

Odds and ends: mostly onsite in lovely downtown San Mateo but flexible hours. Free lunch, ~25 employees, growing in a field that really affects people's lives. Diverse work environment with good, friendly people.
Please apply at https://lumiata.bamboohr.com/jobs/ and contact hr at lumiata.com with any questions.

SurveyMonkey | Senior SRE | San Mateo, CA | Fulltime | Onsite
We're hiring a Senior SRE to work on our Transit team. The Transit team is responsible for the infrastructure relating to the transit of data - this includes caching, messaging, queueing, and application routing (nginx). We're slowly transitioning to be more of a "tier one" team, which means that we'll be responsible for those systems and more - service discovery, site performance, and more.

We're looking for someone to help us maintain these systems and, possibly more importantly, determine the right path for an AWS migration. One of my favorite parts of this job is that we get to work incredibly closely with engineering teams to help them choose the right tools for the job, and then help them implement their use cases around those tools. Our ideal applicant doesn't necessarily have experience with any of these tools, but they do have general ops and/or application engineering experience and are willing and excited to learn the other side. Ideally you're also excited to mentor - a big component of this job is working with engineering teams and helping them build with the infrastructure in mind.

I find the best way to explain our team is to share some of the problems we've been working on:
# Redis Performance
For legacy reasons, we're running multiple instances of redis on a single VM. They've recently started clobbering each other in competition for disk i/o. We've been working on various projects to migrate to new hardware, split the multiple instances to different VMs, and reduce or remove the usage of redis entirely.# Site Routing
As we move more services to AWS, we've had some complications with how we route web requests. How can we ensure the same routing expectations are met in AWS as they are in our on-prem datacenter without massively increasing our operational burden, and having multiple different systems performing the same task in different datacenters?# Network Traffic Reduction
Or, as we've taken to calling it, "the service call diet". This is primarily manifesting as a change in how we make use of our caching systems (other than redis). Some of our services make hundreds of calls to memcache for a single request. This means that any sort of network latency can be magnified 100x over. We've been working with engineering teams to provide caching best practices and to build out a new internal caching library to simplify and abstract our caching infrastructure.If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please email me at tylerl@surveymonkey.com. Come help us build this team!

DataGrail | Senior / Software Engineer | San Francisco | $120k - $170k + 0.25% - %1 | ONSITE
We're building integrations into dozens of SaaS/PaaS to make it easier for companies to fulfill data access, data deletions and opt outs as required by the GDPR and/or the new California privacy bill (CCPA).

Data privacy and data protection should be a no-brainer. But the reality is many departments within organizations are not well-equipped to comply, so we're helping to make that a more seamless process. In doing so, we think this will help give users more control over their personal data.

We have paying customers and have recently raised $4.2m.

Our stack (and growing):

* aws (codedeploy, elasticbeanstalk, rds, lambda, kinesis, athena, etc)

* ruby/rails, go, react

* postgres, redis, s3

Looking for 3+ yrs exp for software engineer and 5+ yrs exp for a senior software engineer.

Experience with data engineering or data science a plus.
If interested, email me (co-founder & cto): iz|at|datagrail.io

Expensify is the most widely used expense management system in the world, with millions of users and more customers than the rest of the industry combined, processing billions of real dollars annually.

We've made the world's first music video you can expense. Check out https://www.expensifythis.com to enter the Expensify This contest and watch the full music video.

We have ~130 employees, are self-managed (no VC control), are extremely profitable, and are working to buy back all shares to become 100% employee owned, intending to create liquidity through internal buyback programs and eventual dividends. As an equal member of the team:


  - Your voice will carry weight on day one.

  - You will work on every part of the codebase, without being constrained to any team, layer, or platform.
  - You will receive a fair, proactive raise bi-annually, without you needing to ask.  
  - You will have the option (not required) to travel with the team domestically and internationally multiple times a year -- spouses and kids welcome (and paid for).  
  - You will be provided the best equipment, a personal mentor committed to your success, tools to encourage a healthy work/life balance, and a workplace that is safe, respectful, collaborative, and inspiring.
  - You will be truly welcome regardless of age, race, gender, orientation, or other affiliation.

Some of the cool things we're working on:

  - Concierge, a “supervised learning” AI-powered customer support platform
  - BedrockDB.com, an open-source, blockchain-based SQL database atop SQLite
  - SmartScan, an OCR/human receipt transcription service
  - Next day ACH processing many millions of dollars daily
  - Scaling realtime search across 30 days (16TB) of system logs
  - Cutting edge web/mobile technologies and so much more!

We are very proud of the team we have built, and would love to have you join our large extended family around the world.  We are happy to sponsor visas and greencards as needed.  All we ask in return is that you get shit done, without ruining it for everyone else: https://blog.expensify.com/2016/06/03/rule-1-get-shit-done/  To apply, just email answers to the following questions to jobs@expensify.com (no resume needed):

  [1] What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?
  [2] Tell us about what it is you do (programming, systems engineering, sales, etc.), when you started, and what you've done between then and now.
  [3] What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?

Dropbox | Machine Learning Engineer | New York City, NY (SF and Seattle also possible) | Onsite, full-time
Dropbox is used by over half a billion people to share knowledge and coordinate work in organizations large and small. Our Machine Learning (ML) team is working on a variety of applications to make this process much easier and reduce the “work about work” that consumes a large part of many people’s days.

From images and videos to documents and audio (in every language!), we tackle it all. We leverage the full range of classic & modern ML techniques (whatever a problem calls for), including {semi,un,}supervised learning, deep learning of all flavors (from CNNs to LSTMs and beyond), and online/interactive learning.

This involves investments into a number of different areas, including deep understanding of many different content types, extracting and representing knowledge to build connections between items, and analyzing file activity and hierarchies — at scale! — to help keep teams more organized and individuals more focused on the work that really matters.

We're looking for people with either academic or practical backgrounds in machine learning, ideally with experience in natural language understanding, information retrieval, or knowledge extraction. We’re growing an ML team within our NYC office and looking for both ML engineers and a NYC-based manager for this team. In addition, we also have openings in our existing ML teams in San Francisco/Bay Area and Seattle as well.

Responsibilities:

-  Work within the Machine Learning Team to prototype, design, code, train, test, deploy, and iterate on large scale machine learning systems.

- Build delightful products and experiences for millions, while working alongside an excellent, cross-functional team across Engineering, Product and Design.

- Help shape the direction of machine learning and artificial intelligence at Dropbox.

Benefits and Perks:

- Having tremendous impact on products used by hundreds of millions of people around the world

- Working with a highly skilled and experienced ML team with backgrounds in industry & academia, across many different fields

- Market competitive total compensation package

- Comprehensive medical, dental, & vision insurance coverage

- 401k + company match

- Generous vacation & volunteer policy

- Free Dropbox space for your friends and family :-)
Please reach out to me to apply, or even just to chat/ask a question! (Contact info in my profile.)

Synthetic Minds (YC S18) | SF + Seattle | $120k+ | First 5 engineers: commensurate equity | ONSITE, Full Time
The ideal candidate has a master/phd in systems, compilers, programming languages, or distributed systems; but never gets to use it in their day job. Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.

Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads/writes smart contracts in Ethereum's Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer's code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can even “synthesize” it.

In Oct 2018, we raised a $5.6M seed round from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [6]. We have paying customers and a backlog waiting to be on-boarded. The team is heavily experienced.  This is the founder’s second startup and they have a PhD in the area. The 1st employee was the first hire at Parse (YC S11) and has 10 yrs at Google. We aim to be a 10-15 person all-engineering team in 2019.
Roles/Openings (see [1]):
# Software engineer: Systems/infrastructure — You’ll be working on distributing heavy CPU processes on AWS. Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node/process/memory/algorithm failures.
# Software engineer: Compilers/verification/synthesis — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover [3]. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.

# Software engineer: Smart contracts — You’ll be working on the “front-end of the compiler”, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis). Desire to work at the compiler level of smart contracts is required, e.g., see [4] — experience in writing smart contracts is easily acquired as a side effect.

TalkJS (https://talkjs.com) | Eindhoven (the Netherlands) | REMOTE (Europe/Africa only)
TalkJS is the chat platform for platforms. We help online marketplaces and communities build great user-to-user communication. Working at TalkJS is fun because you get to make software that is used by other software engineers and that significantly impacts the experience of the users of our customers. Currently we're looking for:

SENIOR FULL-STACK DEVELOPER

Our product is directly used by other developers, so there's deep API design work involved. We want to be faster at shipping new features and making existing features better, which is where you come in. Additionally, we're facing some big scaling challenges. Because of all this, we're looking for an experienced programmer who wants to help get TalkJS to the next level. Our stack consists of Elixir, PostgreSQL, React and TypeScript, but it's acceptable if you don't know all of these as long as you know many others.

We expect you to be fluent in at least 2 programming languages, and to have demonstrably deep experience with either Single-Page Web Applications, or relational databases, and at least some experience in both.

EXPERIENCED MOBILE DEVELOPER

We're about to significantly up our game on iOS and Android. Developer productivity is a core selling point in our TalkJS, so we're looking for someone who thinks they'd be good at designing the best mobile chat API ever made.

We expect you to have extensive experience on both iOS and Android, so that you're able to not just build a usable SDK, but a delightful SDK on both platforms that meshes well with each platform's idioms and conventions.

TECHNICAL SALESPERSON / VP OF SALES

Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing and we're looking for help with (mostly inbound) sales. Our customers are entrepreneurs, product managers and engineers who ask highly technical questions. This means that some experience with software products is required. Ideally you can code a little bit.

You're able to quickly build mutual trust, you're great in (video) calls, and you never let a lead out of your sight. You're able to formulate questions and answers to technical matters precisely and unambiguously so that our dev team can help you close deals. You love software products and you'd love to work with product people all day (both at TalkJS and at our customers).

We're growing quickly and this is our first commercial hire. You're interested and able build out and lead the sales team as the company grows.

ABOUT YOU

Our team is small and highly proactive, and we expect the same from you. If you need to be told what to do all the time, don't apply. If you want to be the smartest person in a (chat) room full of interns, don't apply. If you want to move fast with an experienced team, get in touch.
Apply by sending an email to hey@talkjs.com. (no recruiters or agencies please)

Proda | Senior Full stack engineers | London | Full-time | ONSITE | 50-85k + equity doe.
Proda is an investor-backed, data-mining startup for the commercial real estate industry; we're making data entry jobs less painful. Our clients have been beta testing our application and the feedback's been incredible: https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2018/11/01/proptech-startup-pa....

What about the team? We have a high emphasis on continual learning. If you're not learning something new on the job its time for a new one. Our tech stack reflects this; Haskell and Elm are the main languages. We don't mind if its your first exposure to either. We're not afraid of experimenting or making mistakes. The most important quality of anyone on our team is their ability to learn and teach. Our sales pipeline is miles ahead of our development and we're looking to grow the team to deliver more feature our customers. Since we're still young, working with us means you have a lot of influence in shaping the culture and direction of the company. You'll also a chance to grow your skill set faster than somewhere else.

What about The product? We're building a data mining tool that can explicitly learn a relational data model based on sample inputs. It radically improves data entry and data cleaning for financial analysts. Customers have loved our demos and we're understandably coy in our public descriptions.

This is for someone who:

* is comfortable in functional programming, especially Haskell & Elm; and * is experienced shipping complex web software to production; and * has an eagerness to learn and willingness to share knowledge.

A Typical Day looks like:

* Start off writing a feature that requires elm-ports. These can be tricky, so you pair with another developer who has shipped such code before.

* After lunch you're requested to review a Pull Request that fixes a bug you accidentally introduced a couple weeks back. There's no blame, instead some discussion about how our tests and review process could have caught this earlier.

* The afternoon is spent with the Product guys around a whiteboard. You're helping them sketch out architecture for a complex new data-auditing feature that we'll need to deliver a couple of sprints down the line.

We're far more interested in your capacity to learn then the arcana of specific tech tools, but our platform is largely composed of:


  - Haskell
  - Elm
  - PostgreSQL
  - Python / scikit-learn
  - AWS
  - Automated Testing and CI/CD.

NoRedInk |Engineering Manager/Developer, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with base, bonus, and RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and tiny bits of Rust and Go.

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.
