If you're looking for something quick and dirty to filter jobs or get statistics, this is what I paste in browser console:

    function hideAllExcept(searchRegex) {
        var allComments = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.comment-tree .comtr'))
            .map(function(e){e.style.display='none';return e});
        var topLevelComments = allComments.filter(e=> e.querySelector('img[width="0"]'));
        var matchedComments = topLevelComments.filter(e=> 
            (e.style.display = searchRegex.test(e.querySelector('.comment').innerText) ? 'table-row' : 'none')=='table-row');
        console.log('Showing '+matchedComments.length+' out of '+topLevelComments.length+' jobs for '+searchRegex);
    }
    // Examples. The last one to execute determines what posts are shown.
    hideAllExcept(/\b(Rust)\b/i);
    hideAllExcept(/\b(Java)\b/i);

Shortform | REMOTE | Full-stack Engineer | Full-time / Part-time | $120-200k
https://www.shortform.io/

Do you like reading non-fiction books? Do you find yourself forgetting what you read days later, and feeling like you never absorbed the book's lessons?

Shortform is a book summary product that aims to make ideas actionable. It differs from existing book summary products in 3 major ways:
1) an emphasis on applying the lessons from books, through interactive exercises
2) high-quality summaries, with in-depth chapter by chapter summaries
3) building a community of learners who support each other to apply the lessons from books
Company status: We're in early development. The product roadmap is clear and we're building our engineering team. Shortform is seed-funded by the founder, who has built multiple bootstrapped and profitable companies.

Technology: We haven't finalized the stack but are circulating around Angular/Vue.js/React on frontend, Django/Node.js/Rails on backend. You can help contribute to this decision.

About the role: Ideally you're fullstack on the web, and comfortable on both front-end and back-end. Experience building mobile apps is a plus. Position is remote (current team is in Boston and Chicago). Fulltime / parttime roles available. We're able to pay competitive market salaries (i.e. not decreased by equity).
Email hiring@shortform.io to get more details about the company, our product roadmap, and the role.

<still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Desktop developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer & more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or familiriaty with zero knowledge proofs.

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 5-6months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a managerial/lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)

Vetspire | Full Stack Software Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time | https://vetspire.com
Vetspire is an AI-driven veterinary medical records and practice management platform. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.

We're looking for a couple full stack engineers to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. To do this, you’ll be working at every stage of patient care from the exam room to back-end analytics. Some examples of what your weeks may look like: creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time, designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders, or building a secure messaging platform for client and doctor communications.

You'll be working directly with the vets using Vetspire, and talking with them almost every day to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It's an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone's pets.

Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix/Absinthe application written in Elixir, our front end is a React SPA using the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.

Zulip | https://zulipchat.com/ | REMOTE or in San Francisco | Senior Mobile Engineer | Full-time | SF
Zulip is the leading 100% free and open source alternative to Slack. Our users love Zulip because of our unique UX with threaded conversations; compared to Slack or its clones, they find discussions in Zulip more productive. See our website for details, or read some Hacker News comment threads filled with Zulip love:

* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16863675

* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17622987

* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18400988

We have a handful of people in the USA, amplified by our enormous and amazing open source contributor community. The entire product is open source; we make money selling hosting on Zulip Cloud as well as commercial support for on-site deployments.

This is an open-source job: all our code is open source and free software. We do our development in the open on GitHub and our own public Zulip instance at chat.zulip.org, and dozens of people contribute code every week from all around the world. You can be anywhere in the world too.

We're primarily looking for an experienced engineer excited about taking our mobile apps to the next level. The ideal candidate has full-stack engineering skills, is experienced at participating in open source communities, has great design sense, gets stuff done, and (if not in SF) has done work remotely before, either professionally or in a major open source project. But ideal candidates may not exist, and we're willing to compromise on some of these things :).
We are also always opportunistically hiring for impressive candidates interested in working on other parts of Zulip (UI/design, infrastructure/scalability, growth, etc.).

ConvertKit | Boise, ID | Full-Time | REMOTE only | CEST-PST timezones preferred
ConvertKit is an email marketing platform that helps creators earn a living online.  Read our full reason for existing here: https://convertkit.com/mission/

Here's why you should seriously consider working at ConvertKit:

1. We're bootstrapped.  We're not on the VC train.  We like growth and are growing, but answering to VCs, investors, and all the BS that comes with that is just not part of our world at all.

2. We default to transparency and working in public as much as possible.  Feel free to browse all of our financials here:  https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/

3. We love side projects.  I have my own side project that Nathan even referenced in his most recent blog post (https://nathanbarry.com/product-secrets/). I (me being the Director of Engineering at ConvertKit) personally view side projects as a fantastic, zero-risk way to learn new tech and keep up in the field.

4. Nathan is a kind, generous, nice, and trusting individual. Our culture reflects that.  It's built on a foundation that we trust each other, and therefore we have a very positive, healthy culture.

5. We're growing.  Our growth is accelerating, and we are needing to scale with our growth.  Because of that, we're facing a lot of hard, interesting scaling challenges.  For some engineers, these types of challenges are super fun.  Those are the kind of engineers we're hiring.

4. Other cool perks like paid paid vacation, 2 year equipment credit, 4 weeks of paid vacation, generous maternity/paternity leave, a flexible work schedule, fun team retreats, and being supportive of the needs of those with kids.

Our platform empowers anyone to find and reach out to non-profits to volunteer for the causes they care about.  Non-profits get access to free tools to organize their volunteers. No ads.

Most company documents are available to everyone internally. Technical decisions are only made by the developer team. We are an output-driven, agile team. We do team lunches, fun activities, and team volunteering ourselves during work time (can organize even if you are remote, in your own community).

Prima Assicurazioni (prima.it) | Milan, Italy | Full time | Onsite and italian language required | Backend/Frontend/Fullstack/DevOps | https://www.prima.it/carriera
We are a team of really smart people working in a very well funded startup trying to disrupt insurance in Italy by using technology as our main competitive advantage. We employ a micro service architecture (10s of them are in production atm), Docker and AWS.

Most of our micro services are written in Elixir, we also have some Ruby, Haskell, Python, Go and Rust in production besides a legacy Symfony 2 application, while on the front end side we are mainly using Elm.

We have a lot of automation in place, we run a pretty comprehensive test suite on Drone CI at every push and every developer can spin up QA environments that mirror our entire stack for a given feature branch (this is made possible by having all of our infrastructure managed through CloudFormation templates). All of this allows us to confidently deploy to production multiple times per day.

Our stack:


  AWS (a lot of services), CloudFlare
  OS: Amazon Linux
  EC2 instance number: from ~30 to ~100: we scale automatically a lot of times during the day and treat our infrastructure as immutable
  Infrastructure: CloudFormation + scripts
  CD: Drone CI, Docker (dev -> qa -> staging -> production)
  Container orchestration: AWS ECS
  DB: Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL, Redshift, ElastiCache Redis, DynamoDB
  Monitoring: ELK, DataDog, New Relic, CloudWatch
  Team organization: small cross functional agile teams (every team has at least one person for all of these roles: backend engineer, frontend engineer, web designer, qa engineer, devops engineer)
  Backend languages: Elixir, PHP (we're phasing it out long term), Haskell, Python, Rust, Ruby, Go
  Frontend languages: Elm, Javascript

Stuff that we like:

  Micro service oriented architecture
  Functional reactive programming
  Event sourcing (CQRS)
  Actor model
  Agile (Scrum)
  Domain-driven Design (DDD)

NanoVMs | Kernel Engineer | SF, CA | Remote/Onsite | Full-time/Contractor | https://nanovms.com
We're looking for kernel engineers. You don't need prior professional experience although you should have definitely at least hacked around in the ecosystem before. You'll need at least a basic understanding of lower level filesystems and networking architecture. You should have a love (or hate) of section 2 and 3 of the man pages and know how to go about doing basic static/dynamic analysis. You should know C and have a great understanding of basic data structures and algorithms (cause you'll be creating more advanced ones) - we aren't just stuffing forms into databases for this role.

If you happen to be a performance nut (cycles, nanoseconds, iops, etc.) or a security aficionado (trapsleds? retguards? canaries?) that'd be great!

We are solving real world security issues that even the giants of tech are afflicted with. Current operating systems are not working for us anymore and we are dealing with the reality that we killed off unix a long time ago when we went to the 'cloud'.

We're very partial to on-site fulltime roles in our SOMA SF, CA based office but if you got the chops we're open to other engagements.

If any of this speaks to you get in touch.

Inception/Co-Founders | Cambridge, MA | Full-time | On-site or Remote
Privacy-first Location Services

I'm building a founding team of engineers who are passionate about privacy. And about the potential to architect a mobile app and backend with massive scale and reach. I've co-founded two startups before (2nd one acquired), then took a few years out to study applied science at MIT. Now there's a product I'm insanely passionate about turning into another startup. Working with counsel, I filed two patent applications on a technology solution for getting the benefits of location sharing without reducing any user’s privacy or anonymity. And I've validated the growth model with two key channels who bring a critical mass of users. I have funding: offer of convertible note funding from a friendly VC, and the ability to self-fund this through MVP.
The key roles I'm pulling together are UI/UX, front-end (Swift/iOS first), back end (large data/map optimization), but mostly I'm looking for strong technical generalists who are also excited about building a startup with a culture that loves learning, technical problem solving, and is located walking distance from MIT. Depending on the founding team, we may explore becoming a remote-first company. christian-hn@curatedinnovation.org

I am the CTO at BookMyScan, and we develop online booking systems for diagnostic scans. We have a number of exciting opportunities, and therefore need to expand the development team.

I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.

Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day.  I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.

Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.

We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.
Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 400 people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone. So, you're in luck.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.
Email us at either chris.evans@joinroot.com or tim.hill@joinroot.com to apply and we'll respond to you promptly.

Grain | Backend Engineers | San Mateo, CA | Flex Onsite/Remote | Fulltime | https://www.grain.co
Grain is on a mission to make important team conversations accessible and useful for everyone, even if you weren't in the meeting. We do this by creating a replacement to Google docs that syncs perfectly with your calendar and video conferencing tools so that everyone is on the same page, with a perfect record of what is important but without the busy work. Think of it like TiVo for your team and customer video conference calls.

The team is currently 5, all engineering and one designer. We are looking for backend engineers to work in Elixir/Phoenix (previous experience in BEAM languages preferred but not required). We have an office in San Mateo where we work together at least two days a week but are highly flexible outside of those core working days. We are "stealth"(or whatever that means) but have raised seed funding and are currently selling our first customers. We have not yet "gone to market", so if you're looking to make a big impact and have lots of autonomy/responsibility, then it could be a great fit.

Co-founded by two brothers Mike Adams (co-founder of MissionU & Degreed) and Jake Adams (first employee at Branch), we're assembling a world class team to create a culture shifting software platform to encourage openness, transparency and efficiency.

Kami | Auckland, New Zealand | ONSITE | Full-Stack or Frontend Engineers | Full-time
We’re helping over a million teachers and students eliminate printing and scanning and the associated costs and effort - so our teachers can spend more of their time on achieving better learning outcomes for the next generation.
At Kami, we don’t believe in keeping our engineers locked in the backroom implementing specs sheets - you’ll be talking to the teachers who already love our product, and figuring out how to make Kami work even better in their classrooms. This position will suit an Engineer with a good product sense and is comfortable working relatively autonomously.

We're constantly pushing the boundaries of what you can do in the browser - I just spent the past week tracking down Chrome bugs on the new stylus-enabled Chromebooks! Our frontend is a SPA built in angular, and we have a Rails API/Postgres/GKE/JRuby backend that it talks to.

Most of our users are based in the US, and there may be occasional travel to attend conferences and visit schools using our software, which is a lot of fun! ( See the wrapup from our last conference in Chicago, IL: https://blog.kamihq.com/iste-2018-wrap-up/ )

Our office is in Central Auckland, New Zealand (with great public transport connections), and this position is local, though I will also consider remote candidates :)

Our Data Science team develops new models and algorithms from scratch to make second-order inference on sparse data sets from non-representative samples that generalizes to the underlying target population. We rely on cutting edge models such as persistent homology, PU Learning, and metric learning to make predictions on non-eucldian human sensory data. We don't use tensor flow or pandas or keras as they are not a good fit for our problem space. We prefer a deep understanding of math and stats VS experience running logistic regressions in Python. (but we're cool with Python / Logit / experience)

_Engineering_: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Data-Engineers with experiance in micro-batch processing for machine learning pipelines.
Next Steps: please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

Peakon | Senior Backend Engineers | Mobile Engineer (Android) |  Engineering Manager | Data Scientist | ONSITE Copenhagen, DK or REMOTE Europe
Peakon is the world's leading platform for measuring and improving Employee Engagement. We started Peakon to help companies around the world build better workplaces. We are a data company - not just a survey company - and this allows us to provide insights that will transform businesses.

As part of our company goals for 2019, we are scaling our Engineering and Product team and are currently looking for multiple roles:

* Multiple Senior Backend Engineers (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/941871)

* Android Mobile Engineer (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/726306)

* Data Scientist (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/914473)

Our tech stack of Peakon centers around Javascript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain across the stack, enabling engineers to work on all parts of the system. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use f.ex. Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are big fans of new JavaScript language features like async/await, and have made it a priority to stay up to date with the latest versions of Node. We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with an increasing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.
Trust and transparency guide everything we do. At Peakon you’ll find a transparent salary model, unlimited vacation, minimal hierarchy, and maximum freedom to develop and execute your own ideas. Our style of collaboration is based on honesty and friendship, and we always love making new friends…

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parser generators, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Nimbus for Work | Singapore | Fullstack Dev | Onsite, Full-Time | https://nimbusforwork.com
Note: we can provide a visa if you're interested in moving to Singapore (it's a great place to live)

Nimbus for Work provides services and technology to office spaces in Singapore (and soon other cities in SEA). An analogous company in the USA is ManagedByQ, but the key difference (besides location) is that we employ all of our workers and are committed to paying 20% above market rate. We provide everything that an office needs including cleaning, moving, handymen, leasing plants etc. We build internal tech to make our operations more effective (with the potential to spin it into a SaaS later on), and are looking into other office SaaS tech.

We're seed funded, already profitable and growing fast. Our customers include high profile retail stores, numerous co-working spaces, several MNC's, and other growth-stage startups.

I'm looking for a full stack dev (ideally with React experience) to join our team (which is small, and we intend to keep it that way). There's a lot of tech to implement and plenty of opportunity to take full ownership of different initiatives. Technologies we work with: React, React Native, Elixir (Phoenix), Postgres, AWS/GCP/Firebase, IoT (tracking systems).

Shopify | Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Remote | Full-Time | Infrastructure Engineers
I'm looking for a Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Shopify.

Shopify is a commerce platform, receiving millions of unique visitors each month and serving billions of requests per day.

I lead the Service Communication (RPC) team here, where we're responsible for all 1st party service-to-service communication. In the past year, we've built out the Cusco Platform, our blessed client/server library which product teams are using to ensure their network calls are reliable, resilient and observable.

Right now, we're deep into our integration of our service mesh, which we're using Istio & Envoy to build out. Shopify has an extremely large, multi-cluster Kubernetes deployment on GKE which we're building on. We're running into scaling issues with Istio that we're not sure anyone has seen before.

The team is currently in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and the USA. I'd prefer someone willing to work from one of those locations, but I'm definitely not ruling out remote for the right hire.

Large-scale Kubernetes experience is desired, and experience deploying a service mesh would be a bonus.

Load Impact | https://loadimpact.com/ | Python/Backend Software Engineer | Stockholm, Sweden | FULLTIME | ONSITE or REMOTE
Load Impact is the world’s most widely used online load testing service, with over 100,000 users from 190+ countries and over a million executed load tests - Google “web load test"!

We are a small company but very experienced in developing applications for performance testing and monitoring. We started out as a software development consulting company way back in 2000, developing performance test and measurement software for customers such as Nasdaq and the European space agency. We wrote both hardcore, low-level networking software and high-level web user interfaces and became quite good at both of those things. We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is. In 2009 we took the step and launched loadimpact.com, becoming a product company rather than a consulting company, and we have never looked back.

Recruiting is ongoing. We will respond to your application immediately. If you don’t have a CV ready, don’t create one, send us a link to your Github/LinkedIn with a few sentences about yourself.

Dialbot | Full-stack developer | Remote (US only) | Full-time | https://dialbot.co/
We’re a small, fully remote and self-funded company that helps sales teams connect with prospects faster over the phone. Our customers use our product daily (~10,000 calls/day) and give us regular feedback. Because we’re self-funded, we avoid the hyper-growth of traditional VC startups, and we believe a few people can accomplish a great deal. We validate before we build, work on our own schedule, and execute on a focused vision.

This role is ideal if you like to work across the stack, routing calls through our event-based SIP softswitch, displaying real-time call information in our UI over WebSockets, or processing streaming audio for speech recognition. We use TypeScript/Node.js, Ruby, React, and Postgres.

What we’d love to see:


  - At least 2 years of full-time engineering experience
  - Past work that shows you’re comfortable with both back-end and front-end
  - You like working closely with product and sales to drive customer success
  - You’re not afraid to say “I don’t know,” but that doesn’t stop you from learning

Please reach out at eng@dialbot.co, and feel free to include your resume, why you’re interested, and anything else that’s relevant.

We at Alice are currently in the forefront of scheduling for building structures. The problem we made personal was the inefficiency (and lack of technological improvement) in the construction industry and we aim to solve it by introducing high tech, AI scheduling software to aid in planning and constructing real world projects. We think this is a great problem to solve because no other tech like ours exists. Where most other companies in this space focus on reporting, or task management, we tackle one of the hardest parts, the scheduling itself.
Our space lends us to have to solve many interesting problems from optimization, to modern ux flow, to graph theory, to fault tolerant services. We are currently seeded with a total of 3M funding and are striving to make our series A round. And we'd be happy to have more people on board before dilution :).

ActiveSphere | Bangalore, India | ONSITE | Full Time | Software Engineer, Full stack
We're a boutique software development/consulting company based in Bangalore. Currently, 10 programmers.

Our work depends on client and personal interests/ideas we care about. For clients, these days we are mostly working on Elixir, React. Apart from client work, we spend time understanding and exploring diverse topics and languages. Sometimes these explorations lead to writings like compound interest[1] and creating a visual primer on elixir streams[2], exploring FoundationDB[3], some other times, it leads to discussions in ML or distributed systems, or readings like Understanding Comics, Sapiens, or Art of multiprocessor programming. We care about having colleagues with whom we can grow in our perspectives.

We built a distributed job scheduler in Elixir, a tunneling solution in Go, TypeScript emacs mode (recommended at https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a font converter in Haskell, a DynamoDB emulator in Ruby, a remote debugger (in JavaScript, and Go), a Youtube annotation extension in JavaScript and more[4]

The interview process usually involves a programming problem followed by a few rounds of telephonic/in-person conversations. If interested, please try solving https://www.activesphere.com/problems/regex-gen.html and write back to us at career[at]activesphere.com

QuotaPath | Backend, Frontend or Full-stack Engineer | Philadelphia, PA or Austin, TX | $80K to $150K DOE | Full-Time | On-Site | https://www.quotapath.com/careers/ Happy new year, y’all!
Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.
We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 9 people: 4 engineers, 1 designer and 4 others. I’m one of those 4 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!

Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.
Feel free to reach out to me directly: eric at quotapath dot com

Portchain | Copenhagen, Denmark | Full time | REMOTE | Front-end Software Engineer
We're hiring one front-end developer (NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL) to join our team of 5 remote developers (incl. the engineering manager onsite in Copenhagen).

Experience working remotely. Minimum 4 years of professional software engineering experience.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and starting to get traction through pilot projects, therefore looking for 1 new member to join our team.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.

BECODE - Front-end developer (Angular) | ONSITE (Sydney) or REMOTE | Full-time | https://becode.com.au/
BECODE is looking for a self-starter that can quickly hop on board and join our startup. The dev team currently has five people - two full-time developers and three part-time developers. We're looking to add a third full-time developer to the mix.

To make a long story short, we produce a series of products to serve the construction and engineering industry. One of the products, for example, takes the Building Code of Australia and filters it down to just the parts that are relevant for a client's building. Other products have internal staff as clients seeking to help them with their work. Under the one roof we are actually a group of three startups, two being engineering consulting firms and BECODE doing development.

* Well-funded with a roadmap to last a few years at least.

* Lots of interesting and diverse work across multiple products.

* Lots and lots of greenfield.

* Very flexible working hours.

* Management is very understanding, and you'll be sitting a few metres away the  managing director (who is also the product owner).

The ideal candidate would be able to attend our Martin Place office, but we'd consider remote work and even international remote work from the right person.

The stack you'd be working with is Angular on the frontend, Django on the backend, Postgres as a database with our infrastructure on AWS. You would ideally have a strong understanding and familiarity with Angular, and familiarity with the others being a bonus.
If you're interested in the role, shoot me an email at steven.johns [at] company name [dot] com [dot] au with your resume, a cover letter (no fluff please) and salary expectations. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions too - happy to answer any queries you might have.

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.
Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

OpsLevel | Software Engineer | Toronto, Canada | Onsite | Full-time | https://www.opslevel.com
~About us~

OpsLevel is a very early stage startup based in Toronto, ON.  We're an experienced team of ex-PagerDuty, ex-Amazon, and ex-Shopify.  We have paying customers and just closed our seed round with fantastic Silicon Valley investors.

We want to make the Internet better by helping companies build more reliable software.  We're building a product to bring the site reliability best practices from companies like Netflix and Google to everyone else.

Our users' experience is paramount, so we relentlessly focus on all aspects of UX, from our UI to our APIs.  As developers, we also take great care with code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

Work/life balance is a priority for us.  We have family, friends, and hobbies that we want to attend to at the end of the day (and we suspect you do too).  Elon Musk can keep his 100 hour weeks.  We're happy to grow fast at 40 hours per week.

~About you~

You'll be one of our initial hires and working closely with our CEO, CTO, and other senior employees.

Your day to day will be writing software, but you'll ultimately touch many aspects of the business: talking to customers, defining new features, and then actually implementing those features end to end.  We don't have a lot of process or structure, so you should be good at working independently and getting stuff done.

On the technical side, we care most that you have an insatiable curiosity around technology and software.  You care about improving your craft and can demonstrate how you've done so.

~Stack:~

- Vue.js - Frontend

- Ruby/Rails - Backend / API

- Currently on Heroku (migrating to Terraform, Docker, and AWS)

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. 10 Months ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. You can read more about us here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Coveo | Solution Developer - Implementation | Montreal & Quebec City, Canada | Full-time, ONSITE
You'll implement search based applications that change the digital experience for our customers and their customers. We warn you: it will be no simple task… Coveo has game-changing features out-of-the-box, but you will need great business acumen and technical skills to configure it perfectly to our customer’s environment. We are not talking about the color of the UI here: indexing, in the cloud, millions of documents in hundreds of different systems and deliver search results that are relevant to the user’s situation in less than a second brings its own particular challenges. You'll be making use of JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C# and ASP.NET and are comfortable working on both Windows and Linux.

While we offer all the perks people come to expect of a job (great new offices, top of the line equipment, competitive salaries and insurance, unlimited cappucinos and snacks, nerf gun battles), we think the best part about working with us is simply being excited about going to work every day. On a day to day basis you'll continually face interesting challenges, have great autonomy and you'll be able to bring your ideas to the table knowing that your team genuinely wants to hear them.

Coveo is positioned as the top leader for Insight Engines in Gartner's 2017 Magic Quadrant (http://blog.coveo.com/coveo-leads-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-insight-engines/). We're growing quickly and hiring talented, passionate developers to join our worldclass team. Our Montreal offices are brand new (http://blog.coveo.com/coveo-montreal-finally-home/) and we've also rebuilt our entire Quebec City office to accomodate all our new hires in a great environment.

Interview Process: phone screen - interview - tech test - offer.

MakeLoveNotPorn / Full Stack Developer / Full time / New York or remote /
https://www.makelovenotporn.com/ launched in 2009 with this TED talk: https://blog.ted.com/cindy_gallop_ma/ The extraordinary global response led me to turn MLNP into a business. We're the world's first user-generated human-curated social sex videosharing platform (kind of what Facebook would be if it allowed you to socially sexually self-express and self-identify), celebrating #realworldsex as a counterpoint to porn - we're 'Pro-sex. Pro-porn. Pro-knowing the difference.' We're socializing sex to make it easier to talk about, in order to promote good sexual values and behavior. We operate a revenue-sharing model: members pay to rent and stream social sex videos, and half the income goes to our contributors, or as we call them, MakeLoveNotPornstars. In the era of #metoo, everyone's talking about consent, but nobody knows what it actually looks like in bed: every video on MLNP is a demonstration of consent, good sexual values, good sexual behavior in action. We're spearheading the Social Sex Revolution: the revolutionary part isn't the sex, but the social. More info on what we're doing here:

Our long term goal is to become a one-stop solution to assist drivers with their automotive related challenges. This includes helping drivers finding the best price on auto insurance, leasing & financing options, mechanics etc. We've bootstrapped the company and have dismissed over $10 million worth of fines.

Our team: We are a small development team with members who take on multiple roles across the stack. We strive to always be improving our process and code bases, to use the correct tools for the tasks at hand, and to help grow our collective skills.

Your Role: We’re looking for a full-stack engineer driven to solve challenging problems with a clean and maintainable approach. You will write modular, high-quality code while actively contributing to peer code reviews. You are an intelligent, passionate, and innovative developer that can formulate new ideas and execute them within an existing development environment. Ideally, you enjoy a hands on approach in determining how you and the team can develop technology to meet the company’s business needs.

Skills: We’re seeking developers with full stack skills and experience. Our primary web application is written in Angular, however, we consider ourselves to be a React team.

eCommerce | Devops | CONUS | Part Time/Full Time/Contract? | REMOTE
eCommerce company seeks Devops expertise to help stabilize an older production environment based in AWS.

Skills sought:

- automation expertise (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, whatever - we're agnostic so long as it works).

- CI/CD expertise - we're currently using a mix of 'git pull' and Capistrano, we'd like to modernize a bit.

- monitoring/metrics - our current Nagios system is noisy and long in the tooth.  We'd love to upgrade to 'something different' that isn't waking us up on a regular basis for nothing.

- Rails expertise - our platform runs on Rails.  We suspect having some modicum of expertise in that area would be helpful for our purposes.

- containers/kubernetes?  We're curious if our business would be a fit for a straight-up kubernetes migration.  Bonus points if you can help us figure that out and perhaps implement!

Compensation - Negotiable
Please email Jack (jahodges419 - at - gmail.com) with why you think you'd be a good fit.  TIA!

SWE = Software Engineer
SE = Staff Engineer
DA = Data Analyst
STA = Software Test AutomationHarvest Exchange, Houston, TX (hvst.com)
We provide digital content marketing, reader analytics, and serve as a communications/content distribution platform between large financial institutions and their customers at various tiers throughout the finance industry, with additional white label opportunities.
All positions are ONSITE, for now. We do not have a formal INTERN program, but if the right candidate came along, we would make a competitive offer. There is a lot of experimental stuff an intern could get up to around here.

VISAS: we will sponsor all visas.

The dev team is currently 7, expanding to 10 in the near future. Our primary hiring limitation is to prevent the rapid expansion from being damaging.

We are hiring across the board, at all skill levels, for both SWE and SE (Junior, standard, senior SWE / standard, senior SE). Full Stack preferred, also accepting front end specialists. There are positions above Staff Engineer in our ladder, but we have not hired anyone into them before.

We are also looking for one full time data analyst to help us both answer client needs and delve into our data to assist in making data-driven product decisions. This is not a development role, but coding to munge data will be extremely helpful to applicants.

Streak | Engineering Site Lead | Vancouver, BC | ONSITE

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.

Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Kettlebell Kitchen | https://www.kettlebellkitchen.com | New York, NY | Senior Software Engineer | ONSITE | Full-time
We are looking for quick learners who enjoy working with modern software development tools in the food and manufacturing space.

Knowledge of specific frameworks or libraries is less important than a broad knowledge of software development practices and an ability to learn.

At Kettlebell Kitchen, we're building technology to empower and drive our food manufacturing business. We believe in tried and true business models, like buying raw materials and selling a value-added product. Explosive growth is nice, but not at any cost.

Must haves:

1. Significant experience developing web applications and web sites.

2. Very good grasp of Python 3.5+ or TypeScript. Both are a plus.

3. Some knowledge of the other language listed above.

4. Willingness to work with both ecosystems.

5. Relational database experience, ideally PostgreSQL and MySQL.

6. Knowledge of automated testing - including how much and when to use it.

7. Clear, concise coding skills. Your code is more often described as "clean and elegant" than "clever."

Nice to haves:

1. Understanding of formal methods

2. Bash and vi fu.

3. Mypy and static typing experience in Python.

4. React experience.

5. Django experience.

6. LoopBack experience.

7. Angular experience.

8. Static typing experience in other languages: Java, C++

9. API design

10. Rust experience

11. A love of healthy food or fitness. Or both.

Lumiata | Onsite | San Mateo | Software Engineer - Data Platform, Principal Software Engineer - Data Platform, Senior Software Engineer - Web Platform
We're a medical technology company using machine learning and massive amounts of patient data to improve how the healthcare system works. Our tools process millions of patient records to predict what kinds of medical risk and problems will befall a patient and other medically relevant parameters. Join us to learn about the many intricacies of medical data, how to handle very large volumes of patient records, and how to build pipelines to operationalize cutting-edge machine learning models. We have developed a product major healthcare players want to buy and now need to turn it into something big that will streamline how healthcare works, come help us build it out!

Principal/Software Engineer Data: We work mostly in Python and Scala. Main technologies include Spark, TensorFlow, Airflow and Hadoop among others. We’re always trying new things, and you will be part of making those decisions. We’re looking to build more robust pipelines to transform raw, often human-entered data into standards-compliant forms, and to deploy a wide variety of machine learning/AI models in a scalable, traceable manner.

Senior Software Engineer Web: We are building out a web platform for clients to connect to our platform. This will be a clean-sheet ground-up build and we are looking for someone who can lead that project. Eventually we will hire more for this area, right now we’re looking for the first engineer to lay the groundwork and build initial prototypes.

We need several engineers at 2-3 year and at senior/tech lead level. Requirements for more senior positions shift more toward demonstrated ability to architect and lead projects. In all cases though we look for independence, a strong sense of craft, and solid technical skills.

General Process (based on candidate we make small tweaks):

1.) Phone screen for resume

2.) Short take-home problem

3.) Phone conversation about take-home

4.) Onsite with us

Odds and ends: mostly onsite in lovely downtown San Mateo but flexible hours. Free lunch, ~25 employees, growing in a field that really affects people's lives. Diverse work environment with good, friendly people.
Please apply at https://www.lumiata.com/careers.html and contact hr at lumiata.com with any questions.

Muck Rack (https://muckrack.com) | New York, NY
Muck Rack is a fast-growing SaaS platform for PR teams to effectively find the right journalists for their stories, send customized pitches, collaborate as a team, quantify their impact, and more. We index millions of articles from news outlets around the world. Fortune 500 brands, agencies and startups rely on Muck Rack to manage relationships with the media and boost coverage. We plan to develop several new services this year, and to do that we need to expand our tech team, starting with hiring a VP Engineering.

We’re looking for a VP Engineering with experience scaling an engineering team from 10 to 20 members, someone with good ideas on how to best organize the team as it scales, and who has experience managing remote teams (some of our staff work remotely, and we offer remote to all employees). This will also mean defining and enforcing process and policy as well as deciding the services and technologies we use for development.

We expect you to be capable of hands-on work but we would target an 80/20 split between management and coding. As a manager, you’ll be expected to help your team not only at a technical level and through code reviews, but to advance their careers and streamline their working environment.

Along with engineering you will oversee the infrastructure team and must be comfortable with cloud infrastructure, specifically AWS or GCP, and have had experience efficiently scaling, storing and processing large amounts of data.

This will be a job where you’ll wear many different hats—so we’re only looking for candidates that are comfortable being flexible! You should be able to talk to security, infrastructure, app development and management equally. At the same time we would expect you to weigh in on product decisions and have a business sense that can guide your engineering decisions.

Finally, we want to fill this role because we’re planning for the future. We are a profitable, bootstrapped company that is founder owned, with no VC’s to appease. You will not be coming in to put out fires, but to help us build an amazing company.

Tech

Our tech stack includes Python, Django, MySQL, Celery, Redis, Elasticsearch, Nginx, Gunicorn, Varnish, and Ansible. We don’t expect you to have perfect coverage across these, but do expect that you’ll be able to speak to each core technology.

Invisible Technologies Inc. | Delivery Manager & Relationship Manager | Los Angeles, CA | Full-Time | REMOTE | https://www.inv.tech/
Who are we?

We are Invisible’s Technologies Team. We solve problems at scale so they never happen again. At our best, we solve problems before they happen.
-- Website - https://inv.tech/publications
-- Deck -    https://www.inv.tech/deck
Who are we hiring?

We are hiring Delivery Managers. The right “Delivery Manager” doesn’t need this job description, and won’t wake up in the morning with the thought “I am the Delivery Manager at Invisible,” but with the thought: “Have we taken over the world yet?” The right person already called me, and told me these words:

You should hire me because I will build and lead an elite army of agents to deliver any possible request our clients can have, with the desired outcomes and at ever increasing speeds. Without me, you will never become better, faster, and cheaper. Without me, you will lack the proper project management and coordination systems to deliver the complexity and quantity of work that is needed for you to succeed. Without me, your agents won’t see what it’s like to be lead by an Achilles and Agamemnon. You need me as your thinker and as your warrior, to strategize and to fight.

We are hiring Relationship Managers.  At Invisible, customer success is the core company strategy for Growth. The relationship manager will understand client goals and success state through ongoing collection of data and feedback and ensure that clients achieve their success state using Invisible. They’ll be involved in all aspects of support, account management, demonstrating the product, educating customers and more. All team members look to customer success for input across all key decisions.

Codely | Full Stack Development Instructor | Barcelona, Spain | ONSITE | Contract, Part-Time, Full-Time
Codely, Barcelona’s first all-women coding school, is a social venture that launched in 2018. Our mission is to encourage women, as well as trans, intersex, and gender nonconforming students, to pursue a fulfilling career in tech; to equip them with the skills needed to become leading developers and data engineers in their fields; and to launch a supportive network of professionals who will transform the culture of tech.

We are hiring an instructor for our 11-week full stack development bootcamp starting this June in Barcelona. We are hiring both a part and full time instructor, contractual or permanent.

Classes are intentionally small (6 students or less) so that you can focus on individual mentorship and support. Students meet from 9:30am to 5:30pm daily. Each day will consist of approximately ~2-3 hours of instructor-led lecture or code review. You will have time between lectures to work on curriculum, provide support for students, and prepare for the next day. Classes are taught in English and students come from around the world.

JOB PRIORITIES

I. Delivering a life-changing experience to students.

Your first priority will be to give your students the mindsets and technical skills to succeed as junior engineers. To do this, you will need to be a mentor, teacher, and a coach– responding to learning needs and adjusting curriculum and teaching as required.

II. Taking the curriculum to the next level.

Our curriculum includes: JavaScript fundamentals, data structures, Git, React, Vue, NodeJS, Express, SQL, and Heroku. The foundation (a comprehensive scope and sequence, activities, starter repositories) already exists– but may need modifications. Lecture slides are minimal: you are encouraged to live code examples, use whiteboard explanations, and build more depth into these presentations.

QUALIFICATIONS

- 2-5+ years working as a full stack software engineer

- Knowledge of modern methodologies and JavaScript frameworks

- Patience, friendliness, and the ability to make confusing things less confusing for others

- Preference given to applications with experience working as a teacher and developing curriculum

- Ability to roll with the freedom and independence often associated with start-up culture

Interested? Awesome. Send us an email with your CV and a cover letter at info@codely.tech

corrux | Munich, Germany | ONSITE | INTERNS | https://corrux.io/
Work and grow in an environment driven by ownership, execution and innovation! Disrupt the construction industry with us. We just completed our seed round[1] and are looking to expand rapidly!

-Vehicle Interface Engineer

Help us improve our analysis pipeline by extracting data from construction equipment directly.  We are searching for someone with experience in vehicle interfaces to develop and extend our ability to extract internal messages of the CAN (Controller area network) bus present on e.g. earth-moving machines, and then convert this information into analyzable, actionable metrics and log entries.

This position will involve occasional fieldwork developing connectivity solutions to construction equipment and making sure our existing CAN loggers are functioning correctly.  A big part of this position is also helping us make sense of the often partially documented and proprietary message formats used by different vendors within their vehicles.

-Python Backend and Devops

You will be the catalyst for backend and devops development at corrux, a young startup serving the complex needs of users and data processing in the civil construction space. We specialize in analytics and failure prediction for heavy civil equipment (think railroad track laying machines or tunnel borers).

You will be integrating external OEM and customer data sources into our platform and streamlining deployment, while keeping an eye for scalability and performance, setting up pipelines to extract and normalize data from customer APIs or custom hardware (in batches and real-time), improve our failure forecasting models both in accuracy and performance, and help build more sophisticated CI/CD with an eye towards horizontal scalability and reproducibility across customers.

We're also hiring interns (data science, backend, frontend)!

At Reify Health, we are building a more creative healthcare system. We envision a world where every potential therapy, if safe and effective, is available to the patients who can benefit. Our healthcare system relies on clinical trials to develop new, potentially life-saving treatments for patients. But clinical trials continue to be slow, unpredictable, and expensive.

You'll work with a new data team to support development and expansion of a new, Kappa-style data architecture in a functional programming environment (Clojure!) using Kafka, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and more. You'll also help build data integration services on top of this architecture to help power a new class of analytical/intelligence features for our users. Additionally, we'll be scaling our systems internationally while respecting both regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) and patient privacy.

National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) | DevOps Administrator | Boulder, Colorado USA | ONSITE | Full-time
About NSIDC: The mission of the National Snow and Ice Data Center is to make fundamental contributions to cryospheric science and excel in managing data and disseminating information in order to advance understanding of the Earth system. NSIDC is a trusted source of cryospheric data and services, and is a leader in research and development within this field. We enjoy a broad stable funding base which collectively supports our infrastructure and provides growth in numerous technical fields.

We are, and have been for the last 25 years, a NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) responsible for archival and stewardship of cryospheric data. We also provide data access tools, documentation, processing services, and cryospheric expertise to the public.

This job: This is a new role at NSIDC intended to bridge between our Software Development, Operations, and System Administrations groups. You'll be expected to help evolve our infrastructure, including automated software deployment, software/system monitoring, and operations. Problems you might tackle include: Evolving a centralized logging/visualization infrastructure, positioning the software group for a shift towards processing and data storage in the cloud (a NASA goal), building out a local container orchestration platform, evolving our CI/CD infrastucture, and much more. Our software stack is mostly Python, Javascript, and Ruby. We deploy to vSphere VMs using Puppet, and most new software deployments today are done with Docker.

Personal pitch: Because we are part of a university, we know private industry can offer you a higher salary. However, we offer a starting benefits package that we feel stands out. The university 401(a) plan contributes 10% of gross pay. 22 vacation days, 15 sick days, and 10 holidays a year. UC Boulder insurance benefits are excellent. UC Boulder offers a significant tuition benefit for faculty (that's you), and a smaller benefit for your dependents. Come work here and get your Master's/PhD! Paychecks come once a month, which may be unusual for some. Top of the bill, for me, is the office environment and people. Our current location is dog-friendly, we have shared offices (usually 2-3 in an office) with openable windows (!), and you'll be surrounded with people who care about the work, the overall mission of NSIDC, and learning in general. Our developer group is usually running a book club (currently reading about Elm and just finished "Kanban in Action"), and anyone interested is welcome. You'll likely work directly with people who go to Antarctica every year. Finally, Boulder is beautiful. We have so many trails, everyone loves dogs, and we're about 2 hours from world-class skiing.

* Great communication! Including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing
* The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy
* Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools
* Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc.

The Trade Desk | Full Time, Onsite & Remote | Chicago IL, New York NY, San Jose CA, San Francisco CA, Aliso Viejo CA, Ventura CA, Boulder CO, Denver CO, Bellevue WA, Seattle WA, London UK, Sydney AUS, Shanghai CN
Hiring: Senior Software Engineers, as well as Senior Front-End focused engineers who are comfortable with data-access design, development and optimization. You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk's dev team if:

You are a full-stack engineer who wants to work everywhere, not just a small subset of components. Experience / interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes: client-side React & Redux, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, many-layered data pipeline (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.) that moves hundreds of thousands of items per second, and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all.

* You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#/.Net, but specific experience here is not required.

Cool stuff about TTD:

* Our platform processes 9million+ queries per second

* Work with the best engineering team in AdTech

* The combination of huge data sets, high throughput, low latency and amazing scale means that we're constantly solving some of the biggest challenges in computer science.

* We've grown faster than any other adtech company in the industry, and have been recently recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in America by Inc. Magazine and Deloitte.

* Amazing Company Culture

* Top-tier benefits

If you're interested, please apply directly on our website: https://www.thetradedesk.com/join-us/open-positions
*Note: We are actively hiring a Senior Lead Engineer in Chicago who will assist us in building out Engineering presence in Chicago.

Synthetic Minds (YC S18) | SF + Seattle | $120k+ | First 5 engineers: commensurate equity | ONSITE, Full Time
The ideal candidate has a master/phd in systems, compilers, programming languages, or distributed systems. Synthetic Minds will allow you to leverage your technical chops.

Synthetic Minds is building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code. We have a system in production that reads/writes smart contracts in Ethereum's Solidity language, and we use it to ensure our customer's code is secure and correct. Eventually, we plan on going far beyond smart contracts. Think of what we are building as a compiler that takes code and translates it to theorem proving, so that we can build automation that can understand code almost as close to a human. If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can “synthesize” it.

In Oct 2018, we raised $5.6M from Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital [6]. We have a backlog of customers waiting to be on-boarded. The team is experienced. This is my 2nd YC startup and I have a PhD in Program Synthesis. The 1st employee was the first hire at Parse (YC S11) and spent 10 yrs at Google. We aim to be a 10-15 person all-engineering team in 2019.

Roles/Openings (see [1]):

# Software engineer: Systems/infrastructure — You’ll be working on distributing heavy CPU processes on AWS. Making sure processes run reliably over many days. Ensure robustness of the infrastructure across node/process/memory/algorithm failures.

# Software engineer: Compilers/verification/synthesis — You’ll be working on developing new algorithms that analyze and generate code [2]. You’ll identify when an engineering solution is needed (i.e., throw across a cluster of machines), or when an algorithmic improvement is required. You might even play with the Z3 theorem prover [3]. And if you’re really into it, you can improve Z3.

# Software engineer: Smart contracts — You’ll be working on the “front-end of the compiler”, which reads in smart contracts languages (e.g., Solidity) and makes it accessible to the backend (the part that does semantic analysis). Desire to work at the compiler level of smart contracts is required, e.g., see [4] — experience in writing smart contracts is easily acquired as a side effect.

Adacado | Senior Developer | Vancouver, BC, Canada | ONSITE | Full-timeYou have over 5 years of coding and web application expertise in a senior role, and want to do more innovative development and MUCH less mundane operations support.
“Creating Change is what we do.”
Adacado is looking for expert programmers to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically.   You’re the type of developer that is never satisfied. You strive to create new technologies/design patterns, and/or completely abandoning current systems and undertaking complete re-builds, using all the latest technology.  You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.

“Fail often, fail fast.”

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges.  Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, Node and ES6, and utilizes Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch.  We manage an ever growing army of microservices (100+) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

As a Senior Developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise.  You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis.  You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’.  You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill.  You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues.

The Adacado Team

Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit.  We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.

We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and  stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget.   All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit.  Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks.  We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.

To apply, send us an email: careers@adacado.com  Please indicate that you're applying from Hackernews.

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

NoRedInk | Engineering Manager/Developer, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Hazel Analytics | Full-Stack/Front-End Software Engineer, Product Manager | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $160K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics pairs the largest food safety inspection database with powerful analytics tools and solutions for Fortune 500s and leading organizations in the restaurant, financial services, government, and education industries. With nearly half of the top 100 food retail chains as customers, we do our part to help keep millions of people safe when eating out every day. Customers include Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, and Whole Foods to name a few.

Hazel is the proud recipient of food safety innovation awards from the Food Marketing Institute (2018) and Jack in the Box (2016). We've even had opportunities to be involved in interesting projects such as this recent collaboration with ESPN: http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25316231/health-inspection-reports-find-critical-violations-nfl-nhl-nba-mlb-stadiums-2018-espn-lines

We are profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution.

We're currently seeking experienced full-stack or front-end software engineers to continue growing our engineering team. Our tech stack is predominantly Python (Flask), JavaScript (transitioning from Angular 1 to React), and PostgreSQL, with Docker and Google Cloud featuring in our infrastructure. The team operates in an agile manner, keeping processes to a minimum and enabling engineers to stay focused on their work. We're especially interested in people who are eager to mentor junior engineers and who have past experience in data science, a devops focus, React/Redux experience, or UI/UX skills.

Additionally, we're looking for a product manager to take on significant ownership of our strategic roadmap. We operate in a niche market that intersects with high-profile companies, introducing technology-powered solutions into a traditionally non-digital environment. Our existing customers and partners are highly engaged, and our team has lofty ambitions grounded in strong business cases. If you're passionate about delightful, meaningful technology products and capable of providing the strategic and tactical oversight to fulfill our vision, apply today and join us in transforming the world of food safety.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

Is it just me that I find "stealth" startups seriously delusional in their own idea? Ideas are cheap, execution is difficult. Theranos was "stealth" startup to create investor impression of something like a SkunkWorks project."Abstain from applying if you have/expect a managerial/lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers." - You should really remove this clause from your job listing in future. It reflects bad on the position and gives no hope for the prospects to join and have a promising career that doesn't stall. It’s enough to just say “The position is for an Engineer”.

It would be awesome if you guys could take the time to respond to the applications that you have actually received instead of ignoring applicants without feedback and asking for more CV's (which you need to process) on HN.
You do seem to have a privacy policy[1] in place mentioning GDPR and hiring - it would be great if you could stick to the rules you claim to comply with on your site!

thank you!
