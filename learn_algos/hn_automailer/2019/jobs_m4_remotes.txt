Root | Columbus, OH | Full-time | Onsite / partial remote | $80k-$150k |
https://root.engineering/

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 500 people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone. So, you're in luck.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.
Email us at either chris.evans@joinroot.com or tim.hill@joinroot.com to apply and we'll respond to you promptly.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. Almost a year ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. You can read more about us here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Bagel Health (YC W19) First employee (Full-stack engineer) REMOTE
Work at a YC startup trying to fix healthcare! Bagel is a new electronic health record for the growing direct primary care (DPC) movement. Read more about DPC at dpcnation.org. DPC cuts insurance out of primary care. It makes no sense to use insurance to pay for basic or routine medical services; do you use your car insurance to pay for an oil change? There are some seriously great knock-on benefits of getting rid of insurance too.

Looking for someone who is willing to work below market (roughly ~$60k annualized) until we raise money in 6 months or so. Then the compensation can increase to market rates. Compensation also includes very generous first-employee equity (~4%, standard vesting)

We're still in the early stages of implementation. You'll have a lot of responsibility over software design and architecture decisions.

Here's the tentative stack: Typescript, React, Postgres, Express, Google Cloud, and some Neo4j sprinkled in. Don't worry if you haven't used Neo4j before. Ideally you'd be awesome at a few of these and competent in the rest.
I'm Colin McDonnell, MIT grad, software engineer, the sole founder of Bagel, and nice person. If you're interested in working together, email me at colin(at)bagel(dot)md with a resume and a bit about you and why you're interested!

FlowCommand (YC W16) | Full-Stack Engineer, Data Engineer, Sensor Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | $120k - $150k + 0.5% - 1.0% | https://angel.co/flowcommand
FlowCommand builds a new type of sensor and software system to monitor fluid infrastructure around the world for leaks, theft, spills, and performance. Fleets of our proprietary lightweight hardware generate raw acoustic data and then send that data directly to our server via cellular/satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed) in pipes.

A few upcoming projects:

We’re planning to send a robotic submarine 10,000 ft underwater to attach our sensors to pipelines sitting on the ocean floor, with the goal of detecting and stopping oil leaks that harm marine wildlife. Build the application that allows operators to monitor their pipeline for leaks and alert them to an impending environmental disaster.

Our Houston office has a remotely operable flow loop (ie an obstacle course for fluids) that allows us to approximate field conditions and gather raw acoustic data. The digital signal processing specialists who write our firmware need to capture test data, but the sensor processes millions of measurements per second, making it difficult to store and process the test data. Build a system that allows them to efficiently test their latest DSP algorithms under a variety of flow conditions.
Technologies we currently use:
Web Apps: Python, Django, React 
Data Pipeline: pandas, scikit-learn, Heroku/AWS 
Sensor Firmware: C++, System VerilogPlease reach out at jobs@flowcommand.com

Amazon Web Services - AWS IQ | SDE and/or Web Dev | Seattle, WA or Vancouver, BC | Onsite, Full-time
AWS is cloud company. You've probably heard of us. Although it’s a large organization it’s made up of lots of small product teams. We are a 2-pizza team building a new AWS product we are going to be launching later this year. We need a few more folks to help us launch. Unfortunately we’re pretty secretive about new products so we can’t share too many details about the product with you yet. What we can say is that we're part of the AI division and, as you might guess from the job title, the product involves web technologies. We expect this product to have a huge impact on the entire AWS ecosystem.

In your role you’ll focus on building our web app, but you’ll be expected to act like a startup member and participate in every aspect of creating a great product. That includes innovating, designing, prototyping, developing, testing, deploying and operating this new AWS product. You’ll learn about Amazon’s peculiar culture and internal processes. Our web app is built using common web technology including React/Redux/GraphQL, and Webpack.

Our team is split between Seattle, WA and Vancouver, BC. You can choose to work in either place. Feel free to reach out to me directly at vikhyak@amazon.com if you have any questions or if you'd like to learn more. Alternately you can apply directly here:

Seattle, WA:

Ann Arbor, MI and Columbus, OH | ONSITE To apply, please use either my email address, aclark@nexient.com OR https://www.nexient.com/careers
----- My take -----
(I'm a Sysadmin / DevOps person, I'm not HR or recruitment, but my posting here has been approved by the recruiting dept.)

Nexient are good people: My experience at Nexient has been overwhelmingly positive, they are flexible, caring and fun to work at. They actually care about the life/work balance too. Multiple tabletop, D&D, console gaming nights are organized all the time. Charity drives and other ways to give are also promoted within the company. The work environment is really nice too, with motorized standing/sitting desks and laptops that actually have enough memory!! Nexient do outsourcing but with US-based staff, we work closely with clients so we're just part of the team.

Nexient are also working hard to add hundreds of tech jobs in Michigan and Ohio. There's a real need for good folks to help us help our clients.

----- Recruiting Dept's Description -----

Nexient is hiring! In 2009, we launched Nexient to give American businesses a more responsive, domestic alternative to sending software development offshore. We knew we could deliver better software faster by collaborating with clients in real time. Today, we’re the only 100% US tech company among the World’s Top 100 Outsourcers. Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.
We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks. The list of current openings is available at https://www.nexient.com/careers. These are full time positions working from Nexient’s delivery center at Ann Arbor, MI. Visa sponsorship and telecommute / remote work options are not available for these roles.

WalmartLabs | Software Engineering (Clojure) | SF or REMOTE | FULL TIME
We're a small close-knit team backed by big company resources. We write mission-critical, robust software that's used by millions of Walmart's customers daily.

Our suite of software includes but is certainly not limited to:

- a large distributed system that processes all store transactions from every Walmart and Sam's Club store in the US. If you've ever used Walmart Pay, this is how you get your receipt!

- a massive GraphQL service that powers all customer purchase & returns history for all platforms (written using our own open-source GraphQL implementation for Clojure: https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia). We roll out new marquee customer-facing features in this service almost weekly: everything from tire installation services to bakery orders to propane tanks.

- services to allow customers to manage and purchase care plans

- push notifications

Our tech stack is: Clojure (for everything!), GraphQL, Cassandra, Kafka, Redis, Prometheus, Ruby (for some infrastructure tasks)

Here's a few things we value that you should have:

- A self-starter, curious, and DIY attitude. A lot of our bedrock technology is home-grown and written to solve our own unique Walmart-scale problems. One of the engineers on our team wrote an entire Clojure dialect (https://github.com/candid82/joker/), and scripts written in that language now do a lot of heavy lifting of our own infrastructure.

- A good intuition for writing code that won't fall over under pressure and handles failure states well. We deploy daily and a null pointer might impact millions of requests in a few minutes.

- An interest in doing DevOps-y stuff and a high expectation in good monitoring. We have full ownership of the life-cycle of our code and the servers it runs on.

- The ability to think and work in functional languages (Clojure)

- Experience writing distributed systems with a lot of message passing
If this sounds interesting to you, please reach out to bcarrell@walmart.com and say hello.

-------------------------------------------------------

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and getting traction through pilot projects.

Narrative I/O | Scala Backend Engineer, Angular Frontend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | http://narrative.io/
Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.

- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.

- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.

- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.

We are hiring for a Scala Backend Engineering role and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.
