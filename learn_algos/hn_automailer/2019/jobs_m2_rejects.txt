Commure, Inc. | San Francisco, CA or Boston, MA | Rust Engineer | Fulltime | ONSITE
We are a stealth startup working to fix the software doctors use. If you have seen what physicians have to put up with, it's a bad version of the 90s, and makes medical care worse and more expensive for everyone. We are a group of previously successful engineers and entrepreneurs (MIT, Dartmouth, Stripe, Twitter, Salesforce, DataPower, etc) and senior doctors (Johns Hopkins, UCSF, etc) who are determined to finally fix this.

Compensation: market salary & equity -- we are well funded by top-tier VCs.

Stack: includes Rust, React and Kubernetes. In addition to building our back end in Rust, we are also solving some very interesting problems in the areas of data transformation, high-speed APIs, flexible UX frameworks and fine-grained authorization for healthcare data.

Please email jobs@commure.com and mention "[hnrust]" in the subject line.

<still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Desktop developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer & more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or familiriaty with zero knowledge proofs.

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 5-6months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a managerial/lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)

Vetspire is an AI-driven veterinary medical records and practice management platform. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.

We're looking for a couple full stack engineers to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. To do this, you’ll be working at every stage of patient care from the exam room to back-end analytics. Some examples of what your weeks may look like: creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time, designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders, or building a secure messaging platform for client and doctor communications.

You'll be working directly with the vets using Vetspire, and talking with them almost every day to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It's an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone's pets.

Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix/Absinthe application written in Elixir, our front end is a React SPA using the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.

ConvertKit is an email marketing platform that helps creators earn a living online.  Read our full reason for existing here: https://convertkit.com/mission/

Here's why you should seriously consider working at ConvertKit:

1. We're bootstrapped.  We're not on the VC train.  We like growth and are growing, but answering to VCs, investors, and all the BS that comes with that is just not part of our world at all.

2. We default to transparency and working in public as much as possible.  Feel free to browse all of our financials here:  https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/

3. We love side projects.  I have my own side project that Nathan even referenced in his most recent blog post (https://nathanbarry.com/product-secrets/). I (me being the Director of Engineering at ConvertKit) personally view side projects as a fantastic, zero-risk way to learn new tech and keep up in the field.

4. Nathan is a kind, generous, nice, and trusting individual. Our culture reflects that.  It's built on a foundation that we trust each other, and therefore we have a very positive, healthy culture.

5. We're growing.  Our growth is accelerating, and we are needing to scale with our growth.  Because of that, we're facing a lot of hard, interesting scaling challenges.  For some engineers, these types of challenges are super fun.  Those are the kind of engineers we're hiring.

4. Other cool perks like paid paid vacation, 2 year equipment credit, 4 weeks of paid vacation, generous maternity/paternity leave, a flexible work schedule, fun team retreats, and being supportive of the needs of those with kids.

NanoVMs | Kernel Engineer | SF, CA | Remote/Onsite | Full-time/Contractor | https://nanovms.com
We're looking for kernel engineers. You don't need prior professional experience although you should have definitely at least hacked around in the ecosystem before. You'll need at least a basic understanding of lower level filesystems and networking architecture. You should have a love (or hate) of section 2 and 3 of the man pages and know how to go about doing basic static/dynamic analysis. You should know C and have a great understanding of basic data structures and algorithms (cause you'll be creating more advanced ones) - we aren't just stuffing forms into databases for this role.

If you happen to be a performance nut (cycles, nanoseconds, iops, etc.) or a security aficionado (trapsleds? retguards? canaries?) that'd be great!

We are solving real world security issues that even the giants of tech are afflicted with. Current operating systems are not working for us anymore and we are dealing with the reality that we killed off unix a long time ago when we went to the 'cloud'.

We're very partial to on-site fulltime roles in our SOMA SF, CA based office but if you got the chops we're open to other engagements.

If any of this speaks to you get in touch.
Please check out our careers page or feel free to shoot me a msg or email - ian@ .

BookMyScan | https://bookmyscan.co.uk | Cambridge / London, UK | REMOTE (Europe) | Full-time | Python/Django/PostgreSQL/AWS | Senior Full Stack Developer | £40-£50k
I am the CTO at BookMyScan, and we develop online booking systems for diagnostic scans. We have a number of exciting opportunities, and therefore need to expand the development team.

I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.

Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day.  I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.

Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.

We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.
Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.

As part of our company goals for 2019, we are scaling our Engineering and Product team and are currently looking for multiple roles:

* Multiple Senior Backend Engineers (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/941871)

* Android Mobile Engineer (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/726306)

Our tech stack of Peakon centers around Javascript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain across the stack, enabling engineers to work on all parts of the system. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use f.ex. Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are big fans of new JavaScript language features like async/await, and have made it a priority to stay up to date with the latest versions of Node. We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with an increasing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.
Trust and transparency guide everything we do. At Peakon you’ll find a transparent salary model, unlimited vacation, minimal hierarchy, and maximum freedom to develop and execute your own ideas. Our style of collaboration is based on honesty and friendship, and we always love making new friends…

Shopify | Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Remote | Full-Time | Infrastructure Engineers
I'm looking for a Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Shopify.

Shopify is a commerce platform, receiving millions of unique visitors each month and serving billions of requests per day.

I lead the Service Communication (RPC) team here, where we're responsible for all 1st party service-to-service communication. In the past year, we've built out the Cusco Platform, our blessed client/server library which product teams are using to ensure their network calls are reliable, resilient and observable.

Right now, we're deep into our integration of our service mesh, which we're using Istio & Envoy to build out. Shopify has an extremely large, multi-cluster Kubernetes deployment on GKE which we're building on. We're running into scaling issues with Istio that we're not sure anyone has seen before.

The team is currently in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and the USA. I'd prefer someone willing to work from one of those locations, but I'm definitely not ruling out remote for the right hire.

Large-scale Kubernetes experience is desired, and experience deploying a service mesh would be a bonus.

Dialbot | Full-stack developer | Remote (US only) | Full-time | https://dialbot.co/
We’re a small, fully remote and self-funded company that helps sales teams connect with prospects faster over the phone. Our customers use our product daily (~10,000 calls/day) and give us regular feedback. Because we’re self-funded, we avoid the hyper-growth of traditional VC startups, and we believe a few people can accomplish a great deal. We validate before we build, work on our own schedule, and execute on a focused vision.

This role is ideal if you like to work across the stack, routing calls through our event-based SIP softswitch, displaying real-time call information in our UI over WebSockets, or processing streaming audio for speech recognition. We use TypeScript/Node.js, Ruby, React, and Postgres.

What we’d love to see:


  - At least 2 years of full-time engineering experience
  - Past work that shows you’re comfortable with both back-end and front-end
  - You like working closely with product and sales to drive customer success
  - You’re not afraid to say “I don’t know,” but that doesn’t stop you from learning

Please reach out at eng@dialbot.co, and feel free to include your resume, why you’re interested, and anything else that’s relevant.

Portchain | Copenhagen, Denmark | Full time | REMOTE | Front-end Software Engineer
We're hiring one front-end developer (NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL) to join our team of 5 remote developers (incl. the engineering manager onsite in Copenhagen).

Experience working remotely. Minimum 4 years of professional software engineering experience.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and starting to get traction through pilot projects, therefore looking for 1 new member to join our team.

SEEKING FREELANCERS/EMPLOYEES - NYC preferred, but remote quite conceivable
HappyFunCorp (https://happyfuncorp.com) - We're currently seeking:

BECODE - Front-end developer (Angular) | ONSITE (Sydney) or REMOTE | Full-time | https://becode.com.au/
BECODE is looking for a self-starter that can quickly hop on board and join our startup. The dev team currently has five people - two full-time developers and three part-time developers. We're looking to add a third full-time developer to the mix.

To make a long story short, we produce a series of products to serve the construction and engineering industry. One of the products, for example, takes the Building Code of Australia and filters it down to just the parts that are relevant for a client's building. Other products have internal staff as clients seeking to help them with their work. Under the one roof we are actually a group of three startups, two being engineering consulting firms and BECODE doing development.

* Well-funded with a roadmap to last a few years at least.

* Lots of interesting and diverse work across multiple products.

* Lots and lots of greenfield.

* Very flexible working hours.

* Management is very understanding, and you'll be sitting a few metres away the  managing director (who is also the product owner).

The ideal candidate would be able to attend our Martin Place office, but we'd consider remote work and even international remote work from the right person.

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.
Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.
To learn more about the company and how we operate check out our careers page https://www.streak.com/careers

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. 10 Months ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. You can read more about us here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Requirements:


    * Cross-platform (native or hybrid) app development experience (macOS, Windows, Linux)
    * Familiar with network protocol design, C10K problem, and Go garbage collector highly desired
    * Secure systems design experience is a nice to have (cryptography, AWS KMS, Secrets Manager, etc.)

MakeLoveNotPorn / Full Stack Developer / Full time / New York or remote /
https://www.makelovenotporn.com/ launched in 2009 with this TED talk: https://blog.ted.com/cindy_gallop_ma/ The extraordinary global response led me to turn MLNP into a business. We're the world's first user-generated human-curated social sex videosharing platform (kind of what Facebook would be if it allowed you to socially sexually self-express and self-identify), celebrating #realworldsex as a counterpoint to porn - we're 'Pro-sex. Pro-porn. Pro-knowing the difference.' We're socializing sex to make it easier to talk about, in order to promote good sexual values and behavior. We operate a revenue-sharing model: members pay to rent and stream social sex videos, and half the income goes to our contributors, or as we call them, MakeLoveNotPornstars. In the era of #metoo, everyone's talking about consent, but nobody knows what it actually looks like in bed: every video on MLNP is a demonstration of consent, good sexual values, good sexual behavior in action. We're spearheading the Social Sex Revolution: the revolutionary part isn't the sex, but the social. More info on what we're doing here:

We’re based in San Francisco, but we’re 100% remote. You’ll have the flexibility to work from home or rent a personal office, and set your own schedule. No more long commutes, open plan offices, fixed working hours, or relocating to high cost of living areas. We hire the best people wherever they are.

We currently have a diverse team of over two dozen experts in different technologies from frontend development, backend, DevOps, machine learning and more.

WinIt | Software Engineer | Flatiron, NYC | ONSITE | Full-time | Visa Available | $75k-$115k & Equity | Healthcare & Benefits | https://angel.co/winit-app/jobs/68416-software-engineer
About Us: WinIt is the industry leader helping drivers fight their parking & traffic tickets. Our long term goal is to become a one-stop solution to assist drivers with their automotive related challenges. This includes helping drivers finding the best price on auto insurance, leasing & financing options, mechanics etc. We've bootstrapped the company and have dismissed over $10 million worth of fines.

Our team: We are a small development team with members who take on multiple roles across the stack. We strive to always be improving our process and code bases, to use the correct tools for the tasks at hand, and to help grow our collective skills.

Your Role: We’re looking for a full-stack engineer driven to solve challenging problems with a clean and maintainable approach. You will write modular, high-quality code while actively contributing to peer code reviews. You are an intelligent, passionate, and innovative developer that can formulate new ideas and execute them within an existing development environment. Ideally, you enjoy a hands on approach in determining how you and the team can develop technology to meet the company’s business needs.

Skills: We’re seeking developers with full stack skills and experience. Our primary web application is written in Angular, however, we consider ourselves to be a React team. We’re developing new projects in React, and are actively transitioning our web app to React as well. We use Node.js on the backend, with MongoDB as the datastore for our primary products. We appreciate developers with an array of backend skills, but experience using Node in a backend environment is a must. Mobile experience is a plus, but we are not hiring strictly mobile devs at this time. Our applications are native Android and iOS applications, written in Java and Swift/ObjC respectively.
Experience: Ideally you have previous startup experience, writing production level code, or experience deploying your own projects to a userbase.

eCommerce | Devops | CONUS | Part Time/Full Time/Contract? | REMOTE
eCommerce company seeks Devops expertise to help stabilize an older production environment based in AWS.

Skills sought:

- automation expertise (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, whatever - we're agnostic so long as it works).

- CI/CD expertise - we're currently using a mix of 'git pull' and Capistrano, we'd like to modernize a bit.

- monitoring/metrics - our current Nagios system is noisy and long in the tooth.  We'd love to upgrade to 'something different' that isn't waking us up on a regular basis for nothing.

- Rails expertise - our platform runs on Rails.  We suspect having some modicum of expertise in that area would be helpful for our purposes.

- containers/kubernetes?  We're curious if our business would be a fit for a straight-up kubernetes migration.  Bonus points if you can help us figure that out and perhaps implement!

Compensation - Negotiable
Please email Jack (jahodges419 - at - gmail.com) with why you think you'd be a good fit.  TIA!

We provide digital content marketing, reader analytics, and serve as a communications/content distribution platform between large financial institutions and their customers at various tiers throughout the finance industry, with additional white label opportunities.
All positions are ONSITE, for now. We do not have a formal INTERN program, but if the right candidate came along, we would make a competitive offer. There is a lot of experimental stuff an intern could get up to around here.

VISAS: we will sponsor all visas.

The dev team is currently 7, expanding to 10 in the near future. Our primary hiring limitation is to prevent the rapid expansion from being damaging.

We are hiring across the board, at all skill levels, for both SWE and SE (Junior, standard, senior SWE / standard, senior SE). Full Stack preferred, also accepting front end specialists. There are positions above Staff Engineer in our ladder, but we have not hired anyone into them before.

We are also looking for one full time data analyst to help us both answer client needs and delve into our data to assist in making data-driven product decisions. This is not a development role, but coding to munge data will be extremely helpful to applicants.

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.

Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Muck Rack (https://muckrack.com) | New York, NY
Muck Rack is a fast-growing SaaS platform for PR teams to effectively find the right journalists for their stories, send customized pitches, collaborate as a team, quantify their impact, and more. We index millions of articles from news outlets around the world. Fortune 500 brands, agencies and startups rely on Muck Rack to manage relationships with the media and boost coverage. We plan to develop several new services this year, and to do that we need to expand our tech team, starting with hiring a VP Engineering.

We’re looking for a VP Engineering with experience scaling an engineering team from 10 to 20 members, someone with good ideas on how to best organize the team as it scales, and who has experience managing remote teams (some of our staff work remotely, and we offer remote to all employees). This will also mean defining and enforcing process and policy as well as deciding the services and technologies we use for development.

We expect you to be capable of hands-on work but we would target an 80/20 split between management and coding. As a manager, you’ll be expected to help your team not only at a technical level and through code reviews, but to advance their careers and streamline their working environment.

Along with engineering you will oversee the infrastructure team and must be comfortable with cloud infrastructure, specifically AWS or GCP, and have had experience efficiently scaling, storing and processing large amounts of data.

This will be a job where you’ll wear many different hats—so we’re only looking for candidates that are comfortable being flexible! You should be able to talk to security, infrastructure, app development and management equally. At the same time we would expect you to weigh in on product decisions and have a business sense that can guide your engineering decisions.

Finally, we want to fill this role because we’re planning for the future. We are a profitable, bootstrapped company that is founder owned, with no VC’s to appease. You will not be coming in to put out fires, but to help us build an amazing company.

Tech

Our tech stack includes Python, Django, MySQL, Celery, Redis, Elasticsearch, Nginx, Gunicorn, Varnish, and Ansible. We don’t expect you to have perfect coverage across these, but do expect that you’ll be able to speak to each core technology.

We are Invisible’s Technologies Team. We solve problems at scale so they never happen again. At our best, we solve problems before they happen.
-- Website - https://inv.tech/publications
-- Deck -    https://www.inv.tech/deck
Who are we hiring?

We are hiring Delivery Managers. The right “Delivery Manager” doesn’t need this job description, and won’t wake up in the morning with the thought “I am the Delivery Manager at Invisible,” but with the thought: “Have we taken over the world yet?” The right person already called me, and told me these words:

You should hire me because I will build and lead an elite army of agents to deliver any possible request our clients can have, with the desired outcomes and at ever increasing speeds. Without me, you will never become better, faster, and cheaper. Without me, you will lack the proper project management and coordination systems to deliver the complexity and quantity of work that is needed for you to succeed. Without me, your agents won’t see what it’s like to be lead by an Achilles and Agamemnon. You need me as your thinker and as your warrior, to strategize and to fight.

We are hiring Relationship Managers.  At Invisible, customer success is the core company strategy for Growth. The relationship manager will understand client goals and success state through ongoing collection of data and feedback and ensure that clients achieve their success state using Invisible. They’ll be involved in all aspects of support, account management, demonstrating the product, educating customers and more. All team members look to customer success for input across all key decisions.

Thanks!

National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) | DevOps Administrator | Boulder, Colorado USA | ONSITE | Full-time
About NSIDC: The mission of the National Snow and Ice Data Center is to make fundamental contributions to cryospheric science and excel in managing data and disseminating information in order to advance understanding of the Earth system. NSIDC is a trusted source of cryospheric data and services, and is a leader in research and development within this field. We enjoy a broad stable funding base which collectively supports our infrastructure and provides growth in numerous technical fields.

We are, and have been for the last 25 years, a NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) responsible for archival and stewardship of cryospheric data. We also provide data access tools, documentation, processing services, and cryospheric expertise to the public.

This job: This is a new role at NSIDC intended to bridge between our Software Development, Operations, and System Administrations groups. You'll be expected to help evolve our infrastructure, including automated software deployment, software/system monitoring, and operations. Problems you might tackle include: Evolving a centralized logging/visualization infrastructure, positioning the software group for a shift towards processing and data storage in the cloud (a NASA goal), building out a local container orchestration platform, evolving our CI/CD infrastucture, and much more. Our software stack is mostly Python, Javascript, and Ruby. We deploy to vSphere VMs using Puppet, and most new software deployments today are done with Docker.

Personal pitch: Because we are part of a university, we know private industry can offer you a higher salary. However, we offer a starting benefits package that we feel stands out. The university 401(a) plan contributes 10% of gross pay. 22 vacation days, 15 sick days, and 10 holidays a year. UC Boulder insurance benefits are excellent. UC Boulder offers a significant tuition benefit for faculty (that's you), and a smaller benefit for your dependents. Come work here and get your Master's/PhD! Paychecks come once a month, which may be unusual for some. Top of the bill, for me, is the office environment and people. Our current location is dog-friendly, we have shared offices (usually 2-3 in an office) with openable windows (!), and you'll be surrounded with people who care about the work, the overall mission of NSIDC, and learning in general. Our developer group is usually running a book club (currently reading about Elm and just finished "Kanban in Action"), and anyone interested is welcome. You'll likely work directly with people who go to Antarctica every year. Finally, Boulder is beautiful. We have so many trails, everyone loves dogs, and we're about 2 hours from world-class skiing.

NoRedInk | Engineering Manager/Developer, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

With nearly half of the top 100 food retail chains as customers, we do our part to help keep millions of people safe when eating out every day. Customers include Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, and Whole Foods to name a few.

Hazel is the proud recipient of food safety innovation awards from the Food Marketing Institute (2018) and Jack in the Box (2016).

We are profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution.

We're currently seeking experienced full-stack or front-end software engineers to continue growing our engineering team. Our tech stack is predominantly Python (Flask), JavaScript (transitioning from Angular 1 to React), and PostgreSQL, with Docker and Google Cloud featuring in our infrastructure. The team operates in an agile manner, keeping processes to a minimum and enabling engineers to stay focused on their work. We're especially interested in people who are eager to mentor junior engineers and who have past experience in data science, a devops focus, React/Redux experience, or UI/UX skills.

Additionally, we're looking for a product manager to take on significant ownership of our strategic roadmap. We operate in a niche market that intersects with high-profile companies, introducing technology-powered solutions into a traditionally non-digital environment. Our existing customers and partners are highly engaged, and our team has lofty ambitions grounded in strong business cases. If you're passionate about delightful, meaningful technology products and capable of providing the strategic and tactical oversight to fulfill our vision, apply today and join us in transforming the world of food safety.

Quora | {ML, ML infrastructure} {Engineer, Engineering Manager} | Mountain View, CA | Full-time, ONSITE
Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. We are a web-scale Library of Alexandria, a place where people go to learn about anything and share everything they know.

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past few months we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.

Is it just me that I find "stealth" startups seriously delusional in their own idea? Ideas are cheap, execution is difficult. Theranos was "stealth" startup to create investor impression of something like a SkunkWorks project."Abstain from applying if you have/expect a managerial/lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers." - You should really remove this clause from your job listing in future. It reflects bad on the position and gives no hope for the prospects to join and have a promising career that doesn't stall. It’s enough to just say “The position is for an Engineer”.

It would be awesome if you guys could take the time to respond to the applications that you have actually received instead of ignoring applicants without feedback and asking for more CV's (which you need to process) on HN.
You do seem to have a privacy policy[1] in place mentioning GDPR and hiring - it would be great if you could stick to the rules you claim to comply with on your site!

thank you!
