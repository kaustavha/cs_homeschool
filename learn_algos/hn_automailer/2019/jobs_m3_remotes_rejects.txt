<still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Desktop developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer & more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or familiriaty with zero knowledge proofs.

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 5-6months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a managerial/lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)

Vetspire | Full Stack Software Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time | https://vetspire.com
Vetspire is an AI-driven veterinary medical records and practice management platform. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.

We're looking for a couple full stack engineers to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. To do this, you’ll be working at every stage of patient care from the exam room to back-end analytics. Some examples of what your weeks may look like: creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time, designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders, or building a secure messaging platform for client and doctor communications.

You'll be working directly with the vets using Vetspire, and talking with them almost every day to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It's an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone's pets.

Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix/Absinthe application written in Elixir, our front end is a React SPA using the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.

ConvertKit is an email marketing platform that helps creators earn a living online.  Read our full reason for existing here: https://convertkit.com/mission/

Here's why you should seriously consider working at ConvertKit:

1. We're bootstrapped.  We're not on the VC train.  We like growth and are growing, but answering to VCs, investors, and all the BS that comes with that is just not part of our world at all.

2. We default to transparency and working in public as much as possible.  Feel free to browse all of our financials here:  https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/

3. We love side projects.  I have my own side project that Nathan even referenced in his most recent blog post (https://nathanbarry.com/product-secrets/). I (me being the Director of Engineering at ConvertKit) personally view side projects as a fantastic, zero-risk way to learn new tech and keep up in the field.

4. Nathan is a kind, generous, nice, and trusting individual. Our culture reflects that.  It's built on a foundation that we trust each other, and therefore we have a very positive, healthy culture.

5. We're growing.  Our growth is accelerating, and we are needing to scale with our growth.  Because of that, we're facing a lot of hard, interesting scaling challenges.  For some engineers, these types of challenges are super fun.  Those are the kind of engineers we're hiring.

4. Other cool perks like paid paid vacation, 2 year equipment credit, 4 weeks of paid vacation, generous maternity/paternity leave, a flexible work schedule, fun team retreats, and being supportive of the needs of those with kids.

NanoVMs | Kernel Engineer | SF, CA | Remote/Onsite | Full-time/Contractor | https://nanovms.com
We're looking for kernel engineers. You don't need prior professional experience although you should have definitely at least hacked around in the ecosystem before. You'll need at least a basic understanding of lower level filesystems and networking architecture. You should have a love (or hate) of section 2 and 3 of the man pages and know how to go about doing basic static/dynamic analysis. You should know C and have a great understanding of basic data structures and algorithms (cause you'll be creating more advanced ones) - we aren't just stuffing forms into databases for this role.

If you happen to be a performance nut (cycles, nanoseconds, iops, etc.) or a security aficionado (trapsleds? retguards? canaries?) that'd be great!

We are solving real world security issues that even the giants of tech are afflicted with. Current operating systems are not working for us anymore and we are dealing with the reality that we killed off unix a long time ago when we went to the 'cloud'.

We're very partial to on-site fulltime roles in our SOMA SF, CA based office but if you got the chops we're open to other engagements.

If any of this speaks to you get in touch.

I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.

Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day.  I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.

Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.

We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.
Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.

As part of our company goals for 2019, we are scaling our Engineering and Product team and are currently looking for multiple roles:

* Multiple Senior Backend Engineers (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/941871)

* Frontend Engineering Manager (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/741160)

* Data Scientist (https://peakon.workable.com/jobs/914473)

Our tech stack of Peakon centers around Javascript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain across the stack, enabling engineers to work on all parts of the system. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use f.ex. Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are big fans of new JavaScript language features like async/await, and have made it a priority to stay up to date with the latest versions of Node. We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with an increasing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.
Trust and transparency guide everything we do. At Peakon you’ll find a transparent salary model, unlimited vacation, minimal hierarchy, and maximum freedom to develop and execute your own ideas. Our style of collaboration is based on honesty and friendship, and we always love making new friends…

Shopify | Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Remote | Full-Time | Infrastructure Engineers
I'm looking for a Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Shopify.

Shopify is a commerce platform, receiving millions of unique visitors each month and serving billions of requests per day.

I lead the Service Communication (RPC) team here, where we're responsible for all 1st party service-to-service communication. In the past year, we've built out the Cusco Platform, our blessed client/server library which product teams are using to ensure their network calls are reliable, resilient and observable.

Right now, we're deep into our integration of our service mesh, which we're using Istio & Envoy to build out. Shopify has an extremely large, multi-cluster Kubernetes deployment on GKE which we're building on. We're running into scaling issues with Istio that we're not sure anyone has seen before.

The team is currently in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and the USA. I'd prefer someone willing to work from one of those locations, but I'm definitely not ruling out remote for the right hire.

Large-scale Kubernetes experience is desired, and experience deploying a service mesh would be a bonus.

Deepscope | Backend Developer - JavaScript | London UK, Istanbul Turkey, Ankara Turkey | REMOTE | Part Time or Full Time
Deepscope helps doctors to understand their patients better.  The company is backed by one of the leading Biomedical Research Centres in the UK.

Our Stack

We write JavaScript. We are building a web app with React, a complementary mobile app with React Native and we expect backend code to be also written in JS. We use ESLint with Airbnb rules, Prettier and Flow. Our editor of choice is VSCode, but you may use any editor that provides similar developer experience.

We host our projects on GitLab. CI/CD machines and web app will be hosted on AWS, and we expect backend to be also hosted on AWS.

Our Developers

Our well experienced and even more friendly team consists of two full stack developers, one dedicated to the web app and another to the mobile app.

Our Needs

We need a Relay compatible GraphQL API. We know how the API should look, but we need your help to realize it. You will be responsible for creating, developing and maintaining the whole infrastructure for this API and also securing and setting up scheduled backups for the infrastructure. Frontend and backend will have a customer-provider like relationship, where frontend clearly communicates requirements to the backend, and backend fulfilling these requirements however they see fit.

This GraphQL API will be used to:

Manage users with different roles (moderator, customer, patient) and user groups (organizations)

Manage relations between users (patient of customer) and groups (member of organization)

Handle payments and manage subscriptions

Manage user created content (prescription templates, prescriptions)
Search user created content

SEEKING FREELANCERS/EMPLOYEES - NYC preferred, but remote quite conceivable
HappyFunCorp (https://happyfuncorp.com) - We're currently seeking:

- good Rails, React, and WordPress developers, as well as excellent technical project managers. We prefer people with a reasonable amount of experience under their belt, but there are always exceptions.

- a couple of excellent, principal-level, general-specialist software engineers who are comfortable leading tech teams, helping to identify and solve clients' real (as opposed to reported) problems, architecting solutions from scratch, refactoring existing codebases, putting out occasional fires, and moving fairly seamlessly from one project / language / framework to another.
We do web and app (and occasionally some blockchain) development for a panoply of clients ranging from Fortune 500 to brand-new startups -- right now the distribution is roughly 50-50 -- and we pay well.

BECODE - Front-end developer (Angular) | ONSITE (Sydney) or REMOTE | Full-time | https://becode.com.au/
BECODE is looking for a self-starter that can quickly hop on board and join our startup. The dev team currently has five people - two full-time developers and three part-time developers. We're looking to add a third full-time developer to the mix.

To make a long story short, we produce a series of products to serve the construction and engineering industry. One of the products, for example, takes the Building Code of Australia and filters it down to just the parts that are relevant for a client's building. Other products have internal staff as clients seeking to help them with their work. Under the one roof we are actually a group of three startups, two being engineering consulting firms and BECODE doing development.

* Well-funded with a roadmap to last a few years at least.

* Lots of interesting and diverse work across multiple products.

* Lots and lots of greenfield.

* Very flexible working hours.

* Management is very understanding, and you'll be sitting a few metres away the  managing director (who is also the product owner).

The ideal candidate would be able to attend our Martin Place office, but we'd consider remote work and even international remote work from the right person.

The stack you'd be working with is Angular on the frontend, Django on the backend, Postgres as a database with our infrastructure on AWS. You would ideally have a strong understanding and familiarity with Angular, and familiarity with the others being a bonus.
If you're interested in the role, shoot me an email at steven.johns [at] company name [dot] com [dot] au with your resume, a cover letter (no fluff please) and salary expectations. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions too - happy to answer any queries you might have.

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.
Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

MakeLoveNotPorn / Full Stack Developer / Full time / New York or remote /
https://www.makelovenotporn.com/ launched in 2009 with this TED talk: https://blog.ted.com/cindy_gallop_ma/ The extraordinary global response led me to turn MLNP into a business. We're the world's first user-generated human-curated social sex videosharing platform (kind of what Facebook would be if it allowed you to socially sexually self-express and self-identify), celebrating #realworldsex as a counterpoint to porn - we're 'Pro-sex. Pro-porn. Pro-knowing the difference.' We're socializing sex to make it easier to talk about, in order to promote good sexual values and behavior. We operate a revenue-sharing model: members pay to rent and stream social sex videos, and half the income goes to our contributors, or as we call them, MakeLoveNotPornstars. In the era of #metoo, everyone's talking about consent, but nobody knows what it actually looks like in bed: every video on MLNP is a demonstration of consent, good sexual values, good sexual behavior in action. We're spearheading the Social Sex Revolution: the revolutionary part isn't the sex, but the social. More info on what we're doing here:

No more long commutes, open plan offices, fixed working hours, or relocating to high cost of living areas. We hire the best people wherever they are.

We currently have a diverse team of over two dozen experts in different technologies from frontend development, backend, DevOps, machine learning and more.

WinIt | Software Engineer | Flatiron, NYC | ONSITE | Full-time | Visa Available | $75k-$115k & Equity | Healthcare & Benefits | https://angel.co/winit-app/jobs/68416-software-engineer
About Us: WinIt is the industry leader helping drivers fight their parking & traffic tickets. Our long term goal is to become a one-stop solution to assist drivers with their automotive related challenges. This includes helping drivers finding the best price on auto insurance, leasing & financing options, mechanics etc. We've bootstrapped the company and have dismissed over $10 million worth of fines.

Our team: We are a small development team with members who take on multiple roles across the stack. We strive to always be improving our process and code bases, to use the correct tools for the tasks at hand, and to help grow our collective skills.

Your Role: We’re looking for a full-stack engineer driven to solve challenging problems with a clean and maintainable approach. You will write modular, high-quality code while actively contributing to peer code reviews. You are an intelligent, passionate, and innovative developer that can formulate new ideas and execute them within an existing development environment. Ideally, you enjoy a hands on approach in determining how you and the team can develop technology to meet the company’s business needs.

Skills: We’re seeking developers with full stack skills and experience. Our primary web application is written in Angular, however, we consider ourselves to be a React team. We’re developing new projects in React, and are actively transitioning our web app to React as well. We use Node.js on the backend, with MongoDB as the datastore for our primary products. We appreciate developers with an array of backend skills, but experience using Node in a backend environment is a must. Mobile experience is a plus, but we are not hiring strictly mobile devs at this time. Our applications are native Android and iOS applications, written in Java and Swift/ObjC respectively.
Experience: Ideally you have previous startup experience, writing production level code, or experience deploying your own projects to a userbase.

eCommerce | Devops | CONUS | Part Time/Full Time/Contract? | REMOTE
eCommerce company seeks Devops expertise to help stabilize an older production environment based in AWS.

Skills sought:

- automation expertise (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, whatever - we're agnostic so long as it works).

- CI/CD expertise - we're currently using a mix of 'git pull' and Capistrano, we'd like to modernize a bit.

- monitoring/metrics - our current Nagios system is noisy and long in the tooth.  We'd love to upgrade to 'something different' that isn't waking us up on a regular basis for nothing.

- Rails expertise - our platform runs on Rails.  We suspect having some modicum of expertise in that area would be helpful for our purposes.

- containers/kubernetes?  We're curious if our business would be a fit for a straight-up kubernetes migration.  Bonus points if you can help us figure that out and perhaps implement!

Compensation - Negotiable
Please email Jack (jahodges419 - at - gmail.com) with why you think you'd be a good fit.  TIA!

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.

Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Muck Rack (https://muckrack.com) | New York, NY
Muck Rack is a fast-growing SaaS platform for PR teams to effectively find the right journalists for their stories, send customized pitches, collaborate as a team, quantify their impact, and more. We index millions of articles from news outlets around the world. Fortune 500 brands, agencies and startups rely on Muck Rack to manage relationships with the media and boost coverage. We plan to develop several new services this year, and to do that we need to expand our tech team, starting with hiring a VP Engineering.

We’re looking for a VP Engineering with experience scaling an engineering team from 10 to 20 members, someone with good ideas on how to best organize the team as it scales, and who has experience managing remote teams (some of our staff work remotely, and we offer remote to all employees). This will also mean defining and enforcing process and policy as well as deciding the services and technologies we use for development.

We expect you to be capable of hands-on work but we would target an 80/20 split between management and coding. As a manager, you’ll be expected to help your team not only at a technical level and through code reviews, but to advance their careers and streamline their working environment.

Along with engineering you will oversee the infrastructure team and must be comfortable with cloud infrastructure, specifically AWS or GCP, and have had experience efficiently scaling, storing and processing large amounts of data.

This will be a job where you’ll wear many different hats—so we’re only looking for candidates that are comfortable being flexible! You should be able to talk to security, infrastructure, app development and management equally. At the same time we would expect you to weigh in on product decisions and have a business sense that can guide your engineering decisions.

Finally, we want to fill this role because we’re planning for the future. We are a profitable, bootstrapped company that is founder owned, with no VC’s to appease. You will not be coming in to put out fires, but to help us build an amazing company.

Tech

Our tech stack includes Python, Django, MySQL, Celery, Redis, Elasticsearch, Nginx, Gunicorn, Varnish, and Ansible. We don’t expect you to have perfect coverage across these, but do expect that you’ll be able to speak to each core technology.

We are Invisible’s Technologies Team. We solve problems at scale so they never happen again. At our best, we solve problems before they happen.
-- Website - https://inv.tech/publications
-- Deck -    https://www.inv.tech/deck
Who are we hiring?

We are hiring Delivery Managers. The right “Delivery Manager” doesn’t need this job description, and won’t wake up in the morning with the thought “I am the Delivery Manager at Invisible,” but with the thought: “Have we taken over the world yet?” The right person already called me, and told me these words:

You should hire me because I will build and lead an elite army of agents to deliver any possible request our clients can have, with the desired outcomes and at ever increasing speeds. Without me, you will never become better, faster, and cheaper. Without me, you will lack the proper project management and coordination systems to deliver the complexity and quantity of work that is needed for you to succeed. Without me, your agents won’t see what it’s like to be lead by an Achilles and Agamemnon. You need me as your thinker and as your warrior, to strategize and to fight.

We are hiring Relationship Managers.  At Invisible, customer success is the core company strategy for Growth. The relationship manager will understand client goals and success state through ongoing collection of data and feedback and ensure that clients achieve their success state using Invisible. They’ll be involved in all aspects of support, account management, demonstrating the product, educating customers and more. All team members look to customer success for input across all key decisions.

Reify Health | Data Engineer (Architecture/Integration) | Boston or Remote | Full-Time | $100,000 - $150,000/year
>> About Us <<

At Reify Health, we are building a more creative healthcare system. We envision a world where every potential therapy, if safe and effective, is available to the patients who can benefit. Our healthcare system relies on clinical trials to develop new, potentially life-saving treatments for patients. But clinical trials continue to be slow, unpredictable, and expensive. Reify Health’s product helps both the research leaders driving forward clinical trials and the doctors and nurses who care for the patient participants.

>> What You'll Do <<

You'll work with a new data team to support development and expansion of a new, Kappa-style data architecture in a functional programming environment (Clojure!) using Kafka, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and more. You'll also help build data integration services on top of this architecture to help power a new class of analytical/intelligence features for our users. Additionally, we'll be scaling our systems internationally while respecting both regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) and patient privacy.

>> How to Apply <<

Zoomforth (https://www.zoomforth.com) | Engineering (Ops, Product, Management) | US-based REMOTE | Full-time
Hey HN readers, we're looking for engineers to join us!

Our product is a site builder that allows enterprise customers to use our WYSIWYG editor to publish websites that are consistently branded and accessible to only a chosen audience.

Founded in 2012, we have a stable and growing base of customers who love what we've made for them, and we need help in the following areas:


  Operations Engineering
    - help ensure our service is working as expected: we're proud that we've maintained 99.95% uptime, and that we fix bugs quickly.
    - understand and maintain our AWS environment, and ensure the security of our systems and data meets a compliance threshold.
    - helping to manage and improve our data storage systems. (e.g. upgrading elastic search or running database migrations)

  Product Engineering:
    - build and improve features in our product. Some recent examples include:
    - improving the theme editor for sites built using our product.
    - improving the experience of new users by simplifying parts of our UI.
    - a feature that helps our customers stay compliant with the GDPR when using our product.

  Engineering Management
    - work with others to determine clear short and long term priorities for the engineering team. 
    - work with engineers to help them meet company goals and their own goals.
    - provide technical insight to teammates who are working on signing customers or keeping them happy.
    - identify gaps and risks in our engineering processes and find ways to reduce them.

Our stack is AWS/MySQL/Python/React/LESS, with tools like Vagrant, Packer, Webpack, and CircleCI.
We're a small distributed team, so it would be a plus if you were a clear writer with some experience with remote work.

If this sounds exciting to you, please apply at https://goo.gl/forms/8WOjyVeQ91lc4U0K3
Thanks!

The Trade Desk | Full Time, Onsite & Remote | Chicago IL, New York NY, San Jose CA, San Francisco CA, Aliso Viejo CA, Ventura CA, Boulder CO, Denver CO, Bellevue WA, Seattle WA, London UK, Sydney AUS, Shanghai CN
Hiring: Senior Software Engineers, as well as Senior Front-End focused engineers who are comfortable with data-access design, development and optimization. You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk's dev team if:

You are a full-stack engineer who wants to work everywhere, not just a small subset of components. Experience / interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes: client-side React & Redux, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, many-layered data pipeline (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.) that moves hundreds of thousands of items per second, and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all.

* You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do most of our work in C#/.Net, but specific experience here is not required.

Cool stuff about TTD:

* Our platform processes 9million+ queries per second

* Work with the best engineering team in AdTech

* The combination of huge data sets, high throughput, low latency and amazing scale means that we're constantly solving some of the biggest challenges in computer science.

* We've grown faster than any other adtech company in the industry, and have been recently recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in America by Inc. Magazine and Deloitte.

* Amazing Company Culture

* Top-tier benefits

If you're interested, please apply directly on our website: https://www.thetradedesk.com/join-us/open-positions
*Note: We are actively hiring a Senior Lead Engineer in Chicago who will assist us in building out Engineering presence in Chicago. We are also hiring Senior Solutions Architects in Sydney and NYC (must have engineering background), as well as Site Reliability Engineers (globally), Programmer Analysts (globally), Product Managers (globally), Application Support Coordinators & Analysts (globally), Data Scientists (globally), and Business Intelligence Analysts (globally)

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

NoRedInk | Engineering Manager/Developer, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.
