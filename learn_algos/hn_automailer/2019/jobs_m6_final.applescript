I saw your post on HN Who's Hiring. Are you still interviewing for any full time software engineering or related roles?  
I'm a generalist software engineer with 6 years of experience overall. Including startups and large enterprise companies. 
I have previous experience with php, frontend, javascript, devops, backend and saw them in your post.

You can find my resume at http://cv.kaustav.me or via my website: http://kaustav.me
LinkedIn: khaldar | https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaldar
Github: kaustavha | https://github.com/kaustavha

I'm currently based out of Toronto, Canada. But open to relocation or remote. 
Do you think I'd be a good fit for any open roles you have? 

Thank you, 
Kaustav Haldar
