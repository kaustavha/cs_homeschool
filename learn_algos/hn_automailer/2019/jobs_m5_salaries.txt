LendKey enables these community financial institutions to bring loans to consumers online, making the end-to-end lending process easy & simple for both borrowers and lenders. Because we're growth stage (founded in 2009, Series C) the team has the advantage of being at a stable company but still have elements of a start-up (115 employees currently).

FlowCommand (YC W16) | Full-Stack Engineer, Data Engineer, Sensor Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | $120k - $150k + 0.5% - 1.0% | https://angel.co/flowcommand
FlowCommand builds a new type of sensor and software system to monitor fluid infrastructure around the world for leaks, theft, spills, and performance. Fleets of our proprietary lightweight hardware generate raw acoustic data and then send that data directly to our server via cellular/satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed) in pipes.

A few upcoming projects:

We’re planning to send a robotic submarine 10,000 ft underwater to attach our sensors to pipelines sitting on the ocean floor, with the goal of detecting and stopping oil leaks that harm marine wildlife. Build the application that allows operators to monitor their pipeline for leaks and alert them to an impending environmental disaster.

Our Houston office has a remotely operable flow loop (ie an obstacle course for fluids) that allows us to approximate field conditions and gather raw acoustic data. The digital signal processing specialists who write our firmware need to capture test data, but the sensor processes millions of measurements per second, making it difficult to store and process the test data. Build a system that allows them to efficiently test their latest DSP algorithms under a variety of flow conditions.
Technologies we currently use
Web Apps: Python, Django, React 
Data Pipeline: pandas, scikit-learn, Heroku/AWS
Sensor Firmware: C++, System VerilogPlease reach out at jobs@flowcommand.com

Curebase | Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE (US only)
Biomedical R&D is at an all-time high, but clinical trials are still expensive, slow, and traditional. The reason is the limited pool of research hospitals which R&D sponsors (like pharmaceutical companies) can use to run their trials. The overhead and training required to do research constrains the supply of these research hospitals, and leads to massive inefficiency.

Curebase takes a new approach. We empower every physician to be a researcher with streamlined software. This lets us run any trial in parallel, and enables sponsors to bring their inventions to market faster than ever.

Today, we use our growing physician network to power studies in many exciting areas of medicine, such as smoking cessation, STD testing, and nutrition. We have also participated in Y Combinator S18 and raised $2.5MM in seed funding.
I'm looking for self-motivated, generalist web engineers to join us early.

Kalepa | Software Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.

Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

FreightFlows | Data Engineer, Devops Engineer. Also Sales/Marketing and Product roles | Boston, MA USA | ONSITE or REMOTE
We're a new startup from Boston (< 6 months old) focused on the $20 Trillion dollar global seaborne trade market.

FreightFlows provides aggregated, predictive analytics for global trade. While maritime data continues to grow in volume and complexity, actionable insights continue to be elusive. The industry instead deals with inaccurate, stale and biased data from many fragmented sources. The complexity of bringing together trusted, timely information means companies have had to rely on dubious, incomplete market insight and therefore make decisions on anecdotal evidence.  FreightFlows uses proprietary data science algorithms to synthesize data into trade truth, predictive analytics and actionable intelligence for traders, shippers, owners and brokers.

Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:
- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.

With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 20 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 60 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.

With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community.

Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company has a freemium business model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."
We are looking to hire full stack software engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

Transcriptic (YC W15) | Scientific Software engineers, Backend Engineers | Menlo Park, CA | https://transcriptic.com | FULL TIME; ONSITE
Transcriptic is creating a fully automated, integrated, and programmatically controlled science lab to change how science is performed and turn science execution into an information technology. Scientists anywhere can define and (reproducibly!) run experiments over the internet on-demand and without investing up-front in a lab facility.

The Transcriptic Common Lab Environment (TCLE) takes Autoprotocol (http://autoprotocol.org/), a high-level JSON description of a science protocols, and executes it on our custom-integrated robotic facilities. The protocols we handle routinely involve solving constraint programming models with thousands of variables and constraints in order to find the best plan that fulfills the scientist’s intent. We are looking for backend engineers to help us with this effort.

Scientists manage their experiments through our web application or via our API. We provide a single platform that controls scientific devices from many vendors in a unified way, and an interface to control our automated labs. We are looking for full-stack engineers to help build out our web app.

Turning science into an information technology requires being able to encode, abstract, and execute scientific intent programmatically. We work to span the gap between science and our software stack to ensure that science is being correctly abstracted and faithfully executed as well as work on the leading edge to create tooling for better protocol development. We are looking for software engineers with scientific knowledge to join our scientific software engineering group to help define and build out how science will be encoded.

Tech stack includes: Linux, Python, Scala, RabbitMQ, Rails, Typescript, React, Ansible, Postgres
Benefits include: full medical/dental/vision insurance; catered lunch and dinner, and a fully stocked kitchen; flexible vacation policy; 401(k) with matching; gym and commuter reimbursement; and education reimbursement up to $3,000/year.

Small businesses have come to expect intuitive, fast, and beautiful software in their personal lives yet deal with old, slow, and clunky software in their business lives. We are changing that.

We've built a three stage rocket to get us to where we want to go:

First Stage (COMPLETE): consulting to gain deep experiences in a complicated domain filled with old legacy incumbants.

Second Stage (IN FLIGHT): scalable configurable enterprise product for manufacturers and construction companies utilizing new technologies and frameworks for hard problems like scheduling and forecasting.

Third Stage (FORTHCOMING): connecting millions of small businesses to their big business counterparts and automating the tedious work that exists at the seams between organizations.

We need talented full stack developers who have empathy for users and love making thoughtful and simple solutions to complex problems; developers who want to see their software used daily. About 70% of our work is currently focused on building software for short run manufacturing companies. We're looking for developers to help us transition and build our experiences and codebase into an increasingly scalable product platform.

We value hard work and perseverance. We have never once given up on a single customer and have worked tirelessly through endless challenges to ensure that we are delivering value and that each and every company we touch is better after using our software.

We value proactive work, open-mindedness, self-sufficiency, and subscribe to the idea that knowledge and continuous learning is valuable even it is not directly applicable. Our favorite tools include C#, TypeScript, NodeJS, Angular, and Kendo. If you have at least 2 years of professional experience building all parts of modern webapps, value autonomy over routine, and are interested in helping us develop the next generation of software for small and medium businesses, reach out to us through the contact info below.

We’re small and dynamic, open to new ideas and the work you do now will have a big impact on shaping how we grow and fine-tune our highly performant multi-billion transaction platform for years to come.

There’s an app out there for everything but most cloud software services are distinctively difficult to use together, and doing so is very labour intensive. With our cutting-edge platform, processes that took hours, or even days, can now happen in seconds.

Customers like Reddit, NPM, Digital Ocean, GitHub, Lyft, and IBM are already reinventing how they work through Tray. Help us usher in the era of automation.
