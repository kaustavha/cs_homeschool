Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies. Among other awesome folks, Yoshua Bengio is one of our advisors, and helps our ML team come up with novel ways of tackling these problems.
We’re looking for:
*  Sr Data Scientists (SLC, UT): Looking for experienced Data Scientists both for our Innovation and Assay Development as well as Image Analysis and Quality teams. You’ll work with our data, biology , high throughput screening (HTS), and engineering teams to identify and answer questions in high-dimensional data.

* Sr Full Stack Software Developer (SLC, UT): Looking for experienced Full Stack Software Developers for our Accelerated Pharma and Experiment Design/Lifecycle teams. You’ll work closely with Biologists, Automation Scientists, and Data Scientists to build the infrastructure and applications needed to decode human biology and reinvent drug discovery.

* Software Engineering Manager (SLC, UT): Looking for an experienced Software Engineering Manager to join our team. You’ll lead and guide two of the most important aspects of our organization - our people and the definition/execution of our technical strategy.

* Machine Learning Scientist (Anywhere): Looking for a highly experienced senior/principal-level Machine Learning Scientist who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.
Additional roles we are hiring for: 
* Biologist, Computational Chemists, Automation Engineer, and Drug Discovery experts.
