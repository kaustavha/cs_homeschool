Stacker | React & Python Developers  | REMOTE | FULL-TIME + PART-TIME | https://stacker.app
Stacker lets you build web apps, without code, in your browser.

And not just landing pages and splash sites either. We're talking full-on, pixel-perfect, I-cant-believe-its-not-code apps that can do complex stuff: communities, marketplaces, business systems, social networks. We think there's so much out there that could be built if we just gave people the tools to make it themselves.

We're letting non-developers build apps without code. Unsurprisingly, we need a lot of code to do that. Come and help us build it!

We're hiring:

- React Developers. This ain't your grandma's React app. Help us push React to its limits as we build a frontend builder in a frontend builder https://stacker.app/jobs/react

- Python Developers. We're building a backend that flexibly connects to any data-source (DB or API) and serves it up as if it were our own https://stacker.app/jobs/python

- Fortran Developers. We don't actually use fortran, but it sounds super cool. Keep it up!

We're fully remote (currently based in UK, Switzerland, South Africa, France, Spain + China), and flexible about working arrangements.
If this sounds like the sort of problem you'd like to work on, apply now: https://stacker.app/jobs.

still-unnamed startup in stealth mode> | REMOTE | 20-40h per week freelancers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).
Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Xamarin developer: C# experience as a minimum, F# desirable (we can also mentor you on the transition from C# to F#), interested/knowledgeable in Rust is another plus.

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or zkSNARKs.

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 6months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com
PS: Abstain from applying if you have/expect a managerial/lead role. We need manpower, not decision makers. (That doesn't mean you won't make decisions, just that we won't pay you to solely make decisions.)

You'll be part of the "Feelit" (name not final!!1!) product team and will help build our server-less and micro-services backend systems using sql, ruby, nodejs, and python. You will help scale and maintain our infrastructure on AWS.

We're laid back (I mean come on, we're making a video app for memes) and fun to work with. Although its a stress free and creative work environment we take our features and product releases seriously. Other benefits include flexible working hours, remote working days, extended Japanese holidays, and stock options.

You'll work out of our HQ in Harajuku, the center of pop-culture in Japan. Your colleagues are engineers from all over the world: Japan, Australia, China, India, Mexico, United Kingdom, and the United States of America (point is we're very diverse; gotta catch 'em all).

Personal | Software Developer Apprentice | New York, NY | REMOTE / FULL TIME / INTERNS | https://airtable.com/shr7Gxoh0jDu3Dwr8
I'm hiring a Software Developer Apprentice, full-time and paid.

There will be an emphasis on learning and quality, not speed of development. You'll work on: frontend and backend web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, and APIs.

=============================

Software Developer Apprentice

This is an excellent opportunity for an aspiring software developer who is eager to learn by doing.

Details:

The position is full-time and paid. Day to day work will be remote, but candidates may prefer to relocate to New York City temporarily for in person mentorship and learning opportunities.

In this position you will be tasked with a variety of software development projects spanning the entire stack using the following technologies:

* Web frontend: React

* Web backend: Ruby on Rails

* Mobile: iOS with Swift

* Desktop: Cross platform with Electron

* Platform: REST and GraphQL APIs

You will work on real projects and receive mentorship on software development and industry best practices. There will be a strong emphasis on producing quality work and becoming a great developer and less of an emphasis on speed of development.

This is not a typical job at a company. It's a paid full time apprenticeship opportunity working with John Britton in an individual capacity.

Qualifications:

This is an apprenticeship: zero professional experience is required. Candidates must, however, have demonstrated determination and an unwavering desire to learn. Acceptable evidence may include: completed coursework, self study records, side projects, and personal recommendations.
Apply: https://airtable.com/shr7Gxoh0jDu3Dwr8

Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | Full-time | https://www.thanx.com/careers/job/1466586/Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing with the same message to everyone. The result is an ever-increasing wave of generic spam that makes it hard for consumers to build deeper, data-driven relationships with their favorite brands. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.
In a nutshell, Thanx ingests data, provides insights, enables actions to drive growth in the business. As a platform, Thanx is a horizontally-scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency system.
Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital), to name a few.Thanx Engineering
Yes, we have an app you can download. But that represents no more than 5% of our codebase. The power of Thanx is massively scalable data pipelines, microservices that power four 9s uptime, intelligent purchase normalization, and matching algorithms  — we don’t show that stuff off publicly.Here’s more on who we are:
 • Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from startups and successful product companies like Google, Facebook, Intuit, Disney. This is an elite Eng team, period.
 • Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform.
 • Tech: scalable, reliable, high-throughput, low-latency backend systems; beautiful, performant, responsive UIs; user-friendly mobile apps.
 • Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing, and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours. We work and play hard. Be warned! when it comes to Mario Kart, we are super competitive!

MIG Global | Cambridge, UK | Software engineers/developers, full stack preferred - any level of experience | UX Designers <= 3 years experience | REMOTE or ONSITE (flexible) | VISA
MIG Global is a technology-led market research insight company. We use our tech to automate and enable, and aim to deliver relevant data and insight to our clients much more quickly than our competitors are able. We feel there's a window of opportunity open to us to disrupt the market research industry which is, in many ways, quite slow moving and traditional.

Our tech team comprises 15 people, mostly developers, along with two UX designers. I wouldn't go so far as to say based at, but we're centred on The Bradfield Centre in Cambridge, UK. However, most of our team work from home at least some of the time, and we have three substantially remote members. We've become quite proficient at working whilst spread out geographically so we're quite open to full-time remote workers as well. On top of this we also offer a 35 hour work week and flexible working hours.

Our stack is SQL Server, C#/.NET, TypeScript and React for all new systems over the past 18 months and going forward. We have various technologies in our legacy codebase, including JQuery, Angular, MVC and - in our desktop tools - CEF, WPF and WinForms (sorry!). The upcoming year will see something of a sea change with increasing using of R and Python, along with the latter's ecosystem of statistical, data mining, NLP, and ML libraries and integrations.

We are hiring at least half a dozen talented software engineers at all levels of experience to join us. We're also looking for a couple of user experience designers with up to 3 years experience who our senior designers can mentor and develop. Regardless of our role, you’ll be working on our end to end market research, data, and insight delivery platform.

We are happy to pursue sponsorship for the right candidates looking to relocate to the UK.

Streak | Engineering Site Lead | Vancouver, BC | ONSITE
https://www.streak.com/careers/vancouver-site-lead
Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.

Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Learn more about our plans for Vancouver here: https://www.streak.com/offices/vancouver

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. A few days ago, I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.
Check out our open positions at https://www.pathai.com/careers/.

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

NoRedInk |Engineering Manager/Developer, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with base, bonus, and RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

On site or remote in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, or USA.
