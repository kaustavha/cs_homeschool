Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:

- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

I’d specifically like to work with someone on Fullstack Go and Fullstack Rust - which is less about the respective languages and more like guides to building full-stack web applications with each, including third-party libraries, etc. But we’re also looking to write content about Python, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
(I've talked more about our economics of writing books here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17015117)

PathAI | Boston, MA or Austin, TX | https://pathai.com | Onsite / Remote (US)
PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to help detect cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology.

We're making some major decisions around the direction of the platform, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.
Check out our open positions at https://www.pathai.com/careers/.

Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack (see below) and some keywords (blockchain, DLT, bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, smart contracts, DAI, atomic swaps, etc).

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Xamarin developer: C# experience as a minimum, F# desirable (we can also mentor you on the transition from C# to F#), interested/knowledgeable in Rust is another plus.

- Rust/blockchain developer: experience in Rust, or smart contracts (especially EVM or Ivy) is a must. Desirable to have experience writing bindings or zkSNARKs.

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 6months.

Varonis (www.varonis.com) | New York, NY | Marketing Demand Gen | Full-Time | Remote
Varonis is an enterprise software company (B2B) that helps organizations better secure their data.

This is perhaps not the most glitzy thing, but I really appreciate that:

- The software does what it says

- It's pretty unique in how it does it

- Actually, genuinely useful to the people that use it daily

- Helps protect basically everybody else on the internet

In short, it's something I feel really good about representing and I think that makes marketing it much easier.

The Inbound group is fully remote, large enough to have an actual budget for things, small enough to have some flexibility in execution and be open to new ideas.

We're looking for a very hands-on person who can help increase the number of inbound leads generated by leveraging the work of the existing content and sales teams. We want to build intelligent multi-step campaigns that educate and inform prospects as the first introduction to our company, explore new campaign platforms and make smart data-driven decisions about what to pursue.

I realize marketing jobs aren't usually what gets posted here, but the people who have really thrived at Varonis are both really technical (a third of the marketing team are full stack devs who moved into marketing, myself included) and adept at marketing. Our biggest wins have been when we've been able to cross those two disciplines in a unique way.

PingCAP | Software Engineer, Customer Success | San Mateo and distributed | Full-Time | Remote | https://angel.co/pingcap-1/jobs
We make TiDB, an open source scale-out database that is always consistent, always online, and MySQL compatible. Our underlying distributed key-value layer, TiKV, is a CNCF project.

We have a lot of interesting challenges to keep scaling for our existing users with 100+ TB of data and expanding to help users in new ways with their database needs.

I am part of the international team based out of San Mateo (bay area). Our small team is oriented to being remote, and we travel periodically to meet in person. Much of our team effort is targeted towards making this amazing technology more accessible to the rest of the world [1].

Our tech stack is Rust, Go, Kubernetes, and TiDB itself! You can work on a serverless cloud service, do low-level database hacking, or work directly with customers depending on your existing experience.

I like working on TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a highly-skilled cohesive team. I am constantly learning new things about databases, Kubernetes, etc, but I also get to apply my existing experience to have a big impact.

See the jobs link for more details and compensation.

Cardinal Financial | Remote | Full Time Role
Cardinal Financial, headquartered in Charlotte, NC, is a nationwide direct mortgage lender whose mission is to prove that homeownership is possible for everyone. By bringing an open-minded approach to an often closed-minded industry, we're able to embrace every unique financial situation differently in order to craft the best possible loans for our borrowers.

Our SaaS enterprise mortgage lending platform is a challenging and complex system that includes lender and borrower interfaces, workflow, document management, advanced automation, and integrations with external entities and services.

The server architecture is stateless, cleanly managing the business logic and persistence layer, exposed as a RESTful JSON API. The server is written using a combination of Java 8 on Jetty, and Node.js for asynchronous tasks. We persist our data in MySQL using MyBatis and use Redis for caching, metrics, and non-critical message queueing.

The UI uses a custom, JavaScript MVC framework with many modern techniques: dynamic code loading modules, client-side routing and templates, powerful data-binding features, integrated services, and advanced component architecture.

We develop on Macs and deploy on AWS. Our tools include: github, Jenkins, gradle, grunt, JAXB, iText, Aspose, IntelliJ IDEA, Pivotal Tracker.

The ideal candidate for this role will possess a CS degree and 1-4 years of experience.

Data Science Retreat | Director | Berlin or Montreal | Onsite | Fulltime | Visa | Remote possible for exceptional candidate
Data Science Retreat (DSR) is the market leader in EU for machine learning training. We are expanding to North America, we started in SF but are moving to Montreal. DSR helps coders or people with significant quantitative training (e.g. science, engineering, or math graduates) ramp-up rapidly for a data science career - arguably the fastest-growing, highest-demand profession. Our participants have an average of 5 years of industry experience.

We are launching a new product that is a big departure from our 3-month in-person training:

- For a monthly fee (3 different price points), our customers receive a topic that our teachers prepare in depth. For example, an exciting new technique that just came out in a paper and that is really applicable in the industry today

- There's code that implements the technique, but the most important part is that we provide a detailed explanation and references to every bit of knowledge you need to understand the topic. With exercises that are self-correcting (you write code, press a button, get red/green)

- This business model works well B2C, but it's something easy to consume for big corporates that want to train their people on-the-job (the current 3-month retreat doesn't address this need well). It's all very 'hands on' and more advanced than the usual MOOCs. We suspect MOOCs are not creating data scientists, at least not when done on-the-job. If we can demonstrate results, this should be an easy sell.

As Director of this product, these could be your day to day activities:
- Think up methods to increase our pipeline, together with marketing
- Pay attention to KPIs for recurrent business, for example, churn
- Decide which proportion of revenue goes to service the base, and which to invest in R&D
- Look at customer lifetime value (you don't need to calculate it, we have a resident expert on the team)
- Experiment with variations of product and pricing
- Do outbound sales to convince companies to try our service

Streak | Site Lead | Vancouver, BC | ONSITE
https://www.streak.com/careers/vancouver-site-lead

Streak is establishing our first engineering office outside of San Francisco. We know that it takes focus and intentional planning to make a distributed office a success, and we're looking to partner with an experienced engineer to take on the role of site lead and build out the office.

Your day to day will include:

- Engineering: We're not particular about where in the stack you're looking to contribute (see our existing engineering reqs for some possibilities, but we're flexible), but we are looking for somebody with a strong engineering background who wants to be hands-on as the team gets off the ground. As the team grows, we'll figure out together what division of time makes sense.

- People Management: Work with Vancouver engineers to make sure they're happy, healthy, and engaged. Ensure that the team grows in a way that makes sense for both the office and Streak overall. Facilitate communication both within the site and with the San Francisco team.

- Recruiting: Lead hiring in Vancouver and work with the Streak recruiting team to source great candidates. Attend meetups and events, be the face of Streak in Vancouver.

We are excited about you if you:

- You're an experienced engineer. You've contributed significantly to an evolving codebase and have the learnings to show from it.

- You're an experienced leader. You've been a people manager, a product manager, or a tech lead for a significant team or product.

It would be phenomenal if:

- You have experience with distributed teams, especially in management.

- You're familiar with the tech ecosystem in Vancouver. We're new here ourselves and would love to partner with someone who knows their way around.

Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | ONSITE/REMOTE, Full-time | $160-$200K | https://boards.greenhouse.io/thanx/jobs/903207
Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.
Thanx is fundamentally changing that. Thanx personalizes every interaction between a merchant and their best customers, resulting in measurable increases in revenue for merchants and far greater personalization for consumers. How?
•	Through proprietary partnerships with credit card networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Amex), Thanx can reward consumers for their purchases and deliver highly-customized promotions
•	Through our interactive dashboard, Thanx makes even the smallest marketing team a data-science driven expert in personalization - right message to the right customer at the right time through the right channel.
•	By measuring our success based on revenue generated (not opens and clicks of emails)
Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital).
Thanx Engineering
•	Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from successful product companies like Disney, Google, and Facebook. This is an elite engineering team, period.
•	Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform -- adopted Golang, Elasticsearch, NLP, React, React Native, GraphQL, and added 5+ new microservices; all in the last 12 months. And we are just getting started.
•	Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours and PTO policy. We work and play hard -- be warned, when it comes to Mario Kart, we are super competitive!

If you have a soft spot for bootstrapped, profitable companies with a meaningful product, and you want to use your frontend development skills for good, you’ll like this.
About us:

Drops’ goal is to turn language learning into a delightful game while ensuring effective learning. We teach 31 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - and received the “Best of 2018” title this year! - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe. We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and have releases multiple times a week. We want to be the #1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 9 million, a monthly active of >1,000,000 and an average store rating of 4.7. You can find us here: https://languagedrops.com

About you:

You’ll be responsible for establishing Drops on the web, from a technical perspective. This means a lot of ownership, which we cultivate by having a flat structure.

You’re a no-nonsense person, who is comfortable taking on and managing multiple different projects at the same time, who has been working in working at a product company and has extensive front-end development experience.

You have been working with React for years, have deep knowledge of everything that’s happening in the browser and looking for challenges in growing a product from tens of thousands to millions of visitors per month.

You strongly prefer static typing over dynamic languages, and use every opportunity to transform code that doesn’t use types into code that does. You generally prefer to use a minimal set of simple tools to a diverse range of complex ones.

We’ve built our mobile app with react-native, so we can easily port it to the web and start sharing most of our code - and the challenges that this brings are of your interest.

You like to have a variety of projects - at this job, you’ll be developing a complex web app, a static site generator (gatsby), and even sometimes helping out on our marketing website, that’s being re-built with webflow.

We want everyone to see the big picture: this means you already pushed your boundaries outside of “being a developer” and are knowledgeable about web product growth frameworks, SEO, best practices regarding retention and monetization.

We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product & driven to grow professionally, than in managing people.

We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and freedom. You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.
Please apply through via the following link: https://drops.workable.com/j/6DC995B44D

Second Street | Full-Time Senior Software Engineer | St. Louis | ONSITE, REMOTE (U.S.) for the right candidate
POSITION SUMMARY:

Are you looking to join a fast-paced team and help lead it to success? Are you a well-rounded team player with front-end development experience that can work with the team to find a great solution, write the logic to make it work, and then make it beautiful with CSS? Do you want the ability to impact meaningful change and develop a community where you work? Second Street could be exactly what you've been looking for!

You will be a member of our cross-functional product development team which is made up of designers, testers, and software engineers. You'll enjoy a high level of autonomy while also working very collaboratively in-person and remotely using Slack, Trello, and GitHub. We work together to ship code every day and are constantly looking for ways to improve. We are responsible for a suite of long-lived products that receive constant innovation, feedback, iteration, maintenance, and new feature development.

Software engineers at Second Street are fully involved in every part of the process, from planning, to developing, to testing, to launch. We care deeply and we do things right: version control, automated testing, code reviews, and occasional pair programming. We also focus on work-life balance, including a flexible schedule and work-from-home opportunities, so you won’t be burning the midnight oil here. As a senior front-end software engineer you'll help your teammates work through particularly vexing issues and guide them as they build larger projects, all while keeping an eye toward usability and user experience thanks to your front-end experience.

COMPANY SUMMARY:

We are an audience engagement software platform that is used by over 3,000 media companies and marketers. Some of our leading-edge products include online contests, ballots, polls, quizzes, sweepstakes, email, audience insights, and more. We are seeking tech-savvy professionals who are passionate about our industry, learn quickly, and are motivated to succeed.

Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers-venmo-robinhood-and-other-big-apps.html). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of distributed, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but also want to have flexibility in where they work.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:

You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.

You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.

You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.

You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.

You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

NoRedInk | Full-Stack Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

[3] They used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes. [4]

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)
