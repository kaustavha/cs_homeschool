Instrumental | ONSITE | Palo Alto, CA, USA; Chicago, IL, USA; Charlotte, NC, USA; Longhua, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China
Can you imagine writing software with no debugger or logging, and you only get to run it every few weeks? That's what building hardware is like for many product companies. At Instrumental, we're building a manufacturing optimization system that collects data no one else can, and uses machine learning and visualizations to automatically identify defects and help product companies understand their assembly processes.

With ~30 people we are a small but mighty team with a collaborative, friendly culture. We value an inclusive environment and actively work to promote diversity in our team.

We also value good tools. For example, I manage the web app team - our deploys involve running a single command and take just a few minutes, so we deploy frequently and with confidence. "Watch mode" compilation usually takes under a second. We have "branch environments" to test any pull request in a production-like environment with real data. And we have robust tests.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end.

I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, and we hope developers at any point in their career who have great software engineering chops and potential can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Glow | Lead Software Engineer | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | glow.fm
Glow's mission is to create a world where content realizes its value, starting with helping podcasters build media businesses. Today, we're the easiest and most flexible way for podcasters to build membership programs. Over time, we aim to be for podcasters what Shopify is for e-commerce entrepreneurs. We are 100% aligned with creators and aim to help them succeed by creating a business around what they love to do.

We are looking for a Lead Software Engineer to be one of the early members of our team. This is an opportunity to help build Glow from its earliest days. The role is mostly individual contributor work (technical vision, design, writing code), with some time mentoring 2-3 other engineers on the team.

We promise that you'll never be bored, that you'll be trusted to manage your own time, and that you'll be working on something that makes a difference in the lives of content creators and their fans. Also, we offer a competitive salary, full medical/dental benefits, and unlimited podcasts.

Does the following sound like you? You love podcasts. You are excited about helping creators thrive and build a living around their content. You have strong customer empathy and a track record of building customer-facing products. You work iteratively, shipping often and measuring results. You enjoy a small team where bureaucracy is low but great communication and collaboration is essential. You don’t get hung up on the boundaries of front-end, back-end, dev ops – you do whatever it takes to deliver. You think in terms of architecture and love to stitch together all elements of the software lifecycle to deliver great software. You thrive in the ambiguity and activity of a startup environment.

We closed our $2.3M seed round of financing in August with a great group of investors including Greycroft, Jeff Katzenberg's WndrCo, and the rapper Nas.

We've got two mobile engineers who have experience with both platforms, and we're looking to keep that flexibility and mindset as we grow.

The apps do some unique things, including assisting drivers to plan their trips, find stopovers, manage their electronic duty log, and more—there's a lot more than just CRUD and chat features to go around.

As a remote team, we're super lucky to have some great folks who use the ability to work from home to spend more time with their kids, help volunteer at a school, or otherwise be more fulfilled than they would be working from an office. You could join us!
If that sounds fun and rewarding to you, the full description and info about applying are over here: https://jobs.lever.co/eleostech/e09301bb-0e4e-4ccd-8d5f-e185f7ebd541

Moonfish (https://moonfish.com) | San Francisco, CA | Full-time, Onsite Preferred, but Open to Remote
Moonfish is a big data for consumer travel company, aiming to help people plan and book travel more easily and cheaply (starting with flights). While other travel products start by asking departure/return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).

We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA/Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.

Crisp | Front-end, Data Science, Backend | https://gocrisp.com | REMOTE | Full-time
Crisp is a fully distributed, data-analytics startup working to reduce food waste by improving forecasting across the supply chain.

We're more interested in the quality of the candidate than any particular tech, but I'm listing what we use so you can decide if it's interesting to you.
- Front-end is built on react, typescript, and apollo.
 - Data science uses python, and jupyter.  Must be able to code.
 - Backend is kotlin, graphql, k8s.Limited to mid/senior level candidates because we're entirely distributed.  We just don't feel like we can adequately support remote, junior candidates at this stage of the company.

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React & React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend and mobile, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

Stacker | FULL-TIME | REMOTE ONLY (limited to Europe!) .
We're on a mission to let anyone create software, by building a platform to let you build apps without code.

We want to change the way software is built. That's a pretty big task, and we've got some exciting problems:

.

If you're a PRODUCT-FOCUSED ENGINEER, come and talk to us about how we're building a platform that lets us run rich, flexible apps built without fully code.

You'll be creating a React-based app editor that lets users create software through their browser.

You'll be building a Python-based backend that can connect to any data source, and simulate running complex data processes.

You'll taking ideas from programming language design and turning them into flexible functionality that can be used by non-programmers.

You'll be shipping new modules daily, which are used immediately by our users to make their apps work better and do more.

.

If you're a MULTI-SKILLED PRODUCT DESIGNER (UI+UX+Product), come and help us design a modular product that empowers non-developers to build the software they need.

You'll be creating a flexible design system that we can be customized by the user and still look great.

You'll be taking common web features like news feed and messaging, and stripping them down to their most pure form so they work in any app.

You'll be designing a set of modules that let non-technical users feel empowered and able to create amazing, innovative apps.

.

We're recently funded, and are a fully remote team, but we get together every few months.

We believe in Radical Transparency, being Empathetic and Kind and Making a Dent in the Universe.
Apply at https://stacker.app/hiring . Again, hiring within Europe, and as always, no recruiters ;)

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE | Full-time, ONSITE & REMOTE
Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune ranked us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5] [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, parental leave, fertility/adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 2-3 times a year, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.dauber@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/React/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.

Associate/Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, devops, or security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

FlightAware | Senior Data Scientist / Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Houston, TX | Full-time, ONSITE, https://flightaware.com, https://flightaware.com/commercial/foresight/
FlightAware is expanding its world-class team that builds the predictive technology behind the FlightAware Foresight product suite. FlightAware Foresight is already used by some of the largest airports and airlines in the world to improve operational efficiencies on the ground and in the air. As a senior data scientist at FlightAware, you will work alongside talented developers, systems engineers, and analysts to design, evaluate and improve state-of-the-art machine learning models underlying both current and future Foresight products.

You would bring scientific rigor and statistical methods into a multi-disciplinary engineering group pushing the industry forward and tackling some of the hardest problems in this space. We train thousands of models on hundreds of thousands of CPU cores using datasets with hundreds of millions of examples, and we stream real-time flight data from around the world through these models running on multiple clusters in order to produce thousands of inferences per second. These models compute estimated runway landing and gate arrival times for commercial and GA flights around the world. FlightAware in general processes over 180 million incoming messages per hour from over 22,000 individual data feeds. You would bring a broad technical and engineering background with you, allowing you to design solutions that can scale and operate in this demanding environment.

We're looking for someone with a solid real-world track record of delivering complex machine learning systems in production that solve well-defined business problems. This is decidedly a senior-level role, although less experienced but truly exceptional candidates will be considered. We have no formal requirements about educational background; while a PhD is probably a plus, it's not required, and we're more impressed by real-world results. You need a nontrivial expertise in statistics, machine learning, statistical learning, and deep learning that goes beyond what a talented engineer might learn studying in the evenings for fun. You also need a solid engineering foundation; you wouldn't be isolated from infrastructure and systems engineers but would be working with and alongside them.
FA is a small company (currently ~100 employees), but we're not a startup. We've been around for over a decade and don't rely on VC funding. Our Foresight team alone produces millions of dollars of revenue. The company is successful, profitable, and growing. And we just built out a brand new modern office space in Houston. To apply, please send me an email using the email in my profile here.

At Stateless we are building something special. Not just in terms of a disruptive technology but also in terms of culture. A culture were people authentically personify our organizational values. Supportive. Sincere. Studious. Striving. Stateless.

Stateless is on a mission to reinvent network connectivity. Central to that was our initial innovation, where we demonstrated an ability to efficiently decouple state from processing in network functions—a task deemed infeasible in high-performance networking systems, but in doing so, we have opened the door for fundamentally changing how networks are built. Now, we are building the product around that vision. VCs have backed us, and early adopters have validated the business opportunity.

We are hiring for a variety of roles: from C++ Python and Kotlin developers to sales and support engineers.

WHAT IS INTERCOM? 
Intercom is the world’s #1 business messenger and more.
Whether our customers want to do more with less by leaning on our 100+ apps, we help out  customers’ customers self serve with articles and chat bots, or target chat to specific segments Intercom is customer messaging that fits their business. Intercom is also the best team inbox for sales and support AND the leading choice for targeted outbound messages that deliver. Valued at over $1bn, Intercom has been ranked among the best on the Crunchbase unicorn leaderboard since 2018. In our 8 year history, we’ve built world class sales, marketing and R&D functions, and published a number of books along the way (https://www.intercom.com/books).
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK FOR INTERCOM?
Our culture is open and friendly and inclusive - and this is something we are proud of. We are optimistic, passionate and positive. We like people who can stay focused and work hard and who are confident, yet kind and humble. We like to experiment, sometimes inventing things for the first time, but we stay pragmatic, starting small and simple in everything we do. We love people who genuinely want to learn and grow and take bets on high potential engineers on rapid trajectories.
We’re opinionated by default, for example we run LESS software (https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/) and ship continuously (https://www.intercom.com/blog/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/). We’re technically conservative and like to keep it simple (https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/build-boring-software/), but where it means building better products we’ll double down on new technology like machine learning (https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-fergal-reid-ai-machine-learning/) in a pragmatic way.

TECH: Ruby on Rails application with an Ember.js frontend. We use MySQL, MongoDB and Amazon’s DynamoDB for most of our storage. Our web messenger is built on React.

AWS Developer Tools | Seattle | Software Engineer/Manager, Product, UX | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/
AWS Dev Tools builds the tools that we all use for software development and CI/CD ... at least some of them :-). We're looking for experienced and opinionated engineers, managers, PMs, and UX designers to reinvent how we create, release, and iterate on software quickly and safely.

If you have a background working with different languages (Python, Go, Java, Node, etc...), different platforms (Linux, iOS/Android, MacOS, Web Apps, embedded), different workflow tools (JIRA, Circle CI, Pivotal Tracker, etc...), different organizations (startups, enterprises, governments, universities), I'd like to hear from you.

I come from a startup background and the rest of the team has varied skills - you will learn ALOT here.

Email me (Adam) if you'd like more information: adnelso @at amazon.com

We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools.
