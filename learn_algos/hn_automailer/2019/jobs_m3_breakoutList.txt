BECODE - Front-end developer (Angular) | ONSITE (Sydney) or REMOTE | Full-time | https://becode.com.au/
BECODE is looking for a self-starter that can quickly hop on board and join our startup. The dev team currently has five people - two full-time developers and three part-time developers. We're looking to add a third full-time developer to the mix.

To make a long story short, we produce a series of products to serve the construction and engineering industry. One of the products, for example, takes the Building Code of Australia and filters it down to just the parts that are relevant for a client's building. Other products have internal staff as clients seeking to help them with their work. Under the one roof we are actually a group of three startups, two being engineering consulting firms and BECODE doing development.

* Well-funded with a roadmap to last a few years at least.

* Lots of interesting and diverse work across multiple products.

* Lots and lots of greenfield.

* Very flexible working hours.

* Management is very understanding, and you'll be sitting a few metres away the  managing director (who is also the product owner).

The ideal candidate would be able to attend our Martin Place office, but we'd consider remote work and even international remote work from the right person.

The stack you'd be working with is Angular on the frontend, Django on the backend, Postgres as a database with our infrastructure on AWS. You would ideally have a strong understanding and familiarity with Angular, and familiarity with the others being a bonus.
If you're interested in the role, shoot me an email at steven.johns [at] company name [dot] com [dot] au with your resume, a cover letter (no fluff please) and salary expectations. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions too - happy to answer any queries you might have.

Data privacy and data protection should be a no-brainer. But the reality is many departments within organizations are not well-equipped to comply, so we're trying to help make that a more seamless process. In doing so, we think this will help give users more control over their personal data.

We have paying customers and have recently raised $4.2m.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.
