Finally we are strong enough to write one of these who is hiring ads. Yes, we're hiring!
Who we are: The Modular Company, tech DD services for Venture Capital and Private Equity customers.

We're growing rapidly, we doubled year-on-year for the last three years, looking to do this again this year. Right now we have a mix of part and full-timers that form two teams and we are looking to build a third team in the next three months.

We are looking for an all-round tech person to help out with the Due Diligence work we do, preparation, interviews and report writing. Competitive salary, stock and bonus. If you are curious, want to know what makes things work and would like to join a team that consists of interesting people then please respond, we're color blind, age agnostic (our team spans 3 decades) and would be happy to hire women, men and in fact anybody else as long as they positively contribute to team and atmosphere.

Warning: this work is not for everybody. It is super intense, we deliver a 20-30 page report each week, it is fun and addictive but if you are unable to pace yourself then likely you are better off in a more regulated environment, we are not going to 'hold your hand' but give you all the freedom you need to succeed or mess up. English writing and speaking skills are almost as important as your tech background. We are 'radically transparent', that means that once every month we send out a very detailed report on how the business is doing to ensure that everybody is on the same page. This includes financials, a retrospective of the past month, looking forward to the month ahead and anything else that might be of interest.
Location: Near Amsterdam, Netherlands (Hilversum)
Remote is ok, but some office presence required, we work all over Europe. Some of us work from abroad (Poland) but this is while workable, not ideal so if you're in or near Amsterdam or Hilversum that would be better.
You may contact me through jacques@modularcompany.com if you're interested.
No recruiters or agencies please.

Materials Project | Berkeley, CA | ONSITE | Full-time | https://materialsproject.org
Berkeley Lab (https://www.lbl.gov/) is looking for a talented web developer who will work on building powerful web-based tools for materials scientists on the Materials Project team (see https://materialsproject.org). The Materials Project is one of the world’s foremost databases of computed materials science data, and has helped pioneer a change in how we design and search for new materials, with a large active community of users in both academia and industry. We use millions of CPU hours a year in our calculations, and all of this data is publicly available and free of charge, and we develop all our software openly and under open source licenses.

This is a great opportunity for a developer with an interest in science and energy-related innovation. You'll work with a team of scientists and engineers and will have a major impact on any aspect of the project that interests you — from application architecture to data visualization.

A successful applicant will have experience in:

* HTML/CSS

* JavaScript — someone who is happy to help maintain our legacy platform {Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, Require.js} but is also not afraid of new technologies where appropriate {React / Plotly Dash}

* Web services technologies and REST APIs

* Information visualization — knowledge of javascript graphing libraries such as {d3, HighCharts, Plotly} and understanding of information visualization techniques highly relevant

Ideal applicants will also be experienced with:

* Python and Django (or similar framework)

* Writing unit- and end-to-end tests for client side applications

* Unix environments

* User interface design principles

A successful applicant will also:

* Be keen to work as part of a small team, including working with other researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, collaborators) who are excited about sharing their data with the world
If you're interested in applying, or you simply want to ask some questions about the position (I’m the team’s lead web dev), feel free to ping me at dwinston@lbl.gov. The official position description and application portal is at <https://jobs.lbl.gov/jobs/web-developer-1934>, but because Berkeley Lab is a public research institution, the hiring/contract style is different than a typical industry job (e.g. “1-year term appointment” means guaranteed for 1 year at minimum -- this position definitely has long-term, extension-without-reapplication potential; full benefits start from day 1; etc.), so again please feel free to ping me for any clarification. :)

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.
You can email me at users.sf.net, with account name albert.

About the job:

Position is from now until March. Three days a week on my project gets you a free room and free food. Creating a Patreon meets Reddit kinda site. User pays $5/mo, we take $1 to run the servers without ads or tracking, then the remaining $4 gets split evenly between everything they upvoted that month. Philosphies I'm going into this with: Entirely open source, no ads ever, all analytics are purely opt-in. I'm a front end guy and right now I'm grinding my gears with the backend, so anyone that can create node apis secured with JWTs is really who I need.

PathAI | Boston, MA or Austin, TX | https://pathai.com | Onsite / Remote (US)
PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to work toward detecting diseases like cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.
Check out our open positions at https://www.pathai.com/careers/.

University of California, Los Angeles Library | DevOps Systems Engineer | Los Angeles, CA | Full-time | Onsite | https://ucla.in/2IGcURR
We call our Linux Operations Engineering team here at the UCLA Library, Development Support. We do this because it embodies who we are as individuals and the relationships we cultivate with our colleagues. Our mission is to embrace DevOps as a culture, rather than a job description. The focal point of our efforts is to support the Library's software development projects by enabling our developer teammates to use the tools, infrastructure, procedures, and workflows to get the job done with as few hindrances as possible. Within our team, no one throws tasks or responsiblities over a wall - putting the burden on somoneone else. The phrase, "That's not my job", doesn't exist here. We understand that DevOps is everyone's job. We support one another, we don't point fingers of blame, and we see failure as an opportunity to learn.

If this resonates with you, and sounds like a environment you'd like to be a part of, please consider our open position for a Development Support Engineer within the UCLA Library's Digital Initiatives & Information Technology (DIIT) organization.

Command E | Senior Software Engineer (engineer #2) | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE (North America only)
Hi HN! I'm the Founder & CTO of Command E…a lightning-fast, secure way to instantly find anything in the cloud with a simple keyboard shortcut. We're building a desktop app (Electron/React/Redux/SQLite) that syncs cloud data locally to your laptop and provides a Spotlight-like search & command interface on top of your cloud data.

Command E is basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data. It's inspired by the "fuzzy finder" search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, ⌘T in Atom, ⌘P in VSCode, etc.). The app has a lot of polish and a very clean, simple design. We already support many enterprise and consumer cloud services (Salesforce, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Asana, Trello, 15+ more).

We're a small team of 3 Silicon Valley veterans, well-capitalized by top Silicon Valley VC firms + angel investors. Both co-founders are engineers who worked at a VC firm, Eventbrite, and Digg. Our office is at 2nd and Market in San Francisco.
We're looking to hire 2 senior/core engineers. You'll be building a top-notch Silicon Valley company with experienced founders going after a massive market: search. Electron experience (or desire) is a big plus, but we're open to other backgrounds too. My co-founder and I met ~5 years ago through a "Who's Hiring" thread so we're excited to see who responds to this one - please email me at ben@getcommande.com if you’re interested.

In fall 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments; we're now processing over 200k payments every month.

In this role, you will be part of Wave's People Operations team and responsible for carrying out HR and administrative tasks needed to support the team.
Key details:
* Location: We are a remote company and you can be based anywhere between UTC -5 and +4 in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, the UK or US.
* Compensation: $45,000-$65,000 USD (or local equivalent) per year depending on experience, plus equity.
* Travel requirement: You will be expected to spend one week in Africa for company retreats every two months.Requirements: 3+ years of HR experience; native or fluent English; and local work authorization (wherever it is you'd like to be based).

Repod | Mobile Engineer | Full-Time | Remote | San Diego
At Repod, our goal is to empower people to discover, listen, and share great podcasts. Podcasts are unique in that they inspire us, help us learn something new, or captivate us with the way stories are told. Yet, all of these experiences are rarely shared with one another. By connecting people with an easy way to share and discuss podcasts, Repod helps people find and listen to great podcasts.

Currently, we are a two person team (2 cofounders) and are looking for our 1st full-time team member by way of mobile engineer. We are in the midst of a public beta and will be launching in the near future.

As the lead mobile engineer at Repod, you'll initially be working in our main repo developing and launching new features. Repod is built using React Native and relies heavily on a native audio player built in Swift/Java. As we expand our product, you’ll help inform the technologies used in our future growth. The team is small, which means your impact on the company’s success will be instrumental.

We have one requirement — must love podcasts.

Interested? Find our post at  https://angel.co/company/repod/jobs/553851-mobile-engineer or send us a note to hello@repod.io

Warby Parker | New York, NY | Engineering Manager, Data Engineering | Full-time | Onsite preferred but remote possible
As one of the original "clicks to bricks" retailers, Warby Parker has more interesting retail data than almost anybody else. We run our own supply chain, including an in-house optical lab; we built our own ERP; and, with a strong e-commerce site and close to 100 stores, our omnichannel game is on point.

One of our biggest challenges is getting all of that data into a coherent form and making it as easy as possible for analysts to use it. We're transitioning right now from an in-house PostgreSQL database to BigQuery, and in the process developing more mature data governance, data modeling, and general processes around data quality. And at the same time, we're working to take our ETL infrastructure to the next level.

We have a team of seven plus a Product Manager tackling this challenge, with more to come in the future.

What we need next is an Engineering Manager [0] to nurture this team into its next phase of development. Coach them to the next level, identify where we need to grow and succeed, and make it happen. Let's talk!

Kalepa | Machine Learning Engineers, Backend / Data Engineers, Full-Stack Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISAKalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.
One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning through software and cutting-edge analytics leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Stacker | Europe + Africa Timezones | REMOTE ONLY
Stacker lets people build apps without code on a modular app platform. We want to change the way software is built and make it available to everyone.

That's a pretty big task, and we've got some pretty exciting problems:

If you're a FRONTEND ENGINEER, come and talk to us about how we're building an app runtime that lets you specify an entire app in a bunch of JSON config and have it run as a real-time single page app.

If you're a PRODUCT MANAGER, get in touch and we can chat about how we're taking the features common across all web apps and turning them into installable modules that work seamlessly together.

If you're a PRODUCT DESIGNER, tell us how you'd go about creating not just one design system, but a design-system system to allow our users to build apps that are beautiful by default, but be customisable to the finest level.

If you like PINA COLADA and getting CAUGHT IN THE RAIN, then get in touch anyway.

* * *

We're a fully remote team, Europe+Africa timezones only please. We believe in radical transparency, being good people and making a dent in the universe.
Apply at https://stacker.app/jobs or email jobs@stacker.app. Again, Europe+Africa timezones only PLEASE.  :)

Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang) and Javascript for React, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and increasingly Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

What's our work culture like?

We live in a hyper-competitive and fast moving environment, so our attitude is impact-driven. We're constantly in a struggle against time, looking for ways on being more productive, in order to achieve the ambitious goals we set for ourselves. We like processes and agile ideologies, but don't let it hinder our performance and slow us down.
What are the Job Responsibilities?
Lead the front-end team within one of our product verticals.
Take minor architectural decisions and work closely with the Front-end Architect for improving performance, testing tools, build processes, etc.
Lead and participate in a culture of trust, quality, collaboration and continuous innovation, by engaging in code reviews, writing tech specs and automated tests, and organising regular tech talks and discussions.
Who should apply?
We're looking for experienced developers who take pride on their code rather than the frameworks they know (although good programmers know the right frameworks).
Ones who don't mention GIT as a skill on their resume. Ones who don't settle. They are brave enough to dream big and work hard to achieve it.
If this sounds interesting to you, get in touch. Let’s talk and find out if this is the right place for you.

Waive | Los Angeles LA Hollywood | Fullstack PHP Python Product Automotive Mechanical Electrical Engineer | Onsite - Full-Time | DoE
We're a (mostly) electric urban mobility company founded in 2015, a bit before the current wave of them being everywhere.

I'm running a team of 4 engineers and am looking for a few more at our family-sized company which may be doing some scaling soon. We have tens of thousands of customers, millions in assets, it's a real thing.

Here's our plan for the next year or so, listed in order (highest first):

* A new ad platform for our screens (a version we're going to throw away is at waivescreen.com)

* An on-demand gig economy car (see maven, envoy, hyrecar, and getaround for imho, poorly executed examples). This includes

* backoffice work (currently in node but new stuff can be in whatever)

* a new app or some other kind of smartphone presence (stability and Donald-Norman style UX as opposed to art-school UX is all I care about)

* New innovative ad tech (see firefly, grabbit, blip, adomni, etc)

* Open-architecture, open platform telematics that don't suck (see invers & vulog)

This may sound a bit ambitious but really a lamp developer who has read a couple marketing books would be just fine.

So just email me already at chris@waive.car ... you've already made it this far.
Please include a sample of your work.

Rearc | Sr. Engineer | New York, NY | Onsite | Full-Time
At Rearc, our mission is to make all developers happier. We accomplish this by doing two separate, but related things -

The first thing we do is provide consulting services to help companies rearchitect and migrate their apps to leverage modern cloud and software architecture patterns (think 12-factor app, microservices, containers, serverless functions, kubernetes/ecs, public cloud services etc.). We help them remove waste and improve their practices to make the developers that work there happier.

The second thing we do is building an application platform that allows developers to run services, serverless functions, and backend resources in the easiest, most efficient way possible. Our tech stack today is AWS, Javascript (Node.js & Vue.js), Elixir and Go.

We are currently looking for Senior Engineers to help us out on our consulting services to start with. Strong experience with AWS services (like EC2, S3, KMS, RDS), Docker, Terraform and CI/CD tooling is desired.

Competitive salary plus excellent bonus structure and benefits package.

Brace | New York, NY | Onsite | Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Fullstack Engineer
Think Turbo Tax, but for distressed mortgages. It may sound boring, but it turns out that when people can't afford to pay for their houses there is quite a bit you can do to avoid foreclosure. At Brace (https://brace.ai) we're automating advice and document collection to help people stay in their homes. We're a team of four engineers in midtown Manhattan and really positive feedback from initial customers means we have a lot of room to hire for:

- Frontend engineering: it's basically all React (using CRA) and so far that's working out really well.

- Backend engineering: Vert.x on Java11/12 running on AWS' version of managed Kubernetes called EKS

- DevOps: The entire architecture, which must be installed per-client, is described using Terraform. This deploys helm charts, configures AWS, and manages keystores, among many other things. We have considerable monitoring and alerting requirements and all of the early application features we're developing touch multiple parts of the stack.

- Fullstack: An ideal candidate would have interest and experience doing what's listed for backend and devops engineering because, as a small company, we all wear many hats.

The company strives to have the most healthy work-life balance you'll find in a startup that's young enough that you can really take ownership of important application features.
Reach out to me directly at chris [at] brace [dot] ai and just make sure you include HackerNews in the title of the email.

Software Engineering Managers: https://www.vectra.ai/about/careers?gh_jid=1378166

Senior Front End Engineers: https://www.vectra.ai/about/careers?gh_jid=1378605

Our product, Cognito, is based on a simple principle for finding hidden threats: use an authoritative source of data and seek out the fundamental threat behaviors that cybercriminals can’t avoid when they carry out an attack.
To do this, Cognito relies on the only source of truth during a cyberattack – network traffic. Only traffic on the wire – whether in private data centers, public clouds or enterprise environments – reveals the truth with complete fidelity and independence. Low-fidelity perimeter security only shows what you’ve already seen, not the hidden attacks that were missed. Instead of traditional payload inspection, we use AI, machine learning and behavioral traffic analysis to expose the fundamental behaviors of attackers as they spy, spread, and steal in the network – even in encrypted traffic. For more details, see https://vectra.ai/how-it-works.

Based in San Francisco, Whisper is lucky to have the support of great investors including Sequoia Capital, First Round Capital, LUX Ventures, and more.
We're currently around 25 people and hoping to bring on a few more critical technical hires before starting clinical trials in a few months.

--Who we are-- 
We’re a tech based real estate company in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We specifically chose this market because we were driven by the problems we once faced as tenants, owners and property agents. Our vision is to simplify the property acquisition minus the red tapes through taking control over the Agents and backend processes. 
We’re convinced that we are able to solve the issues with duplicated listings, fake agents, and unqualified tenants/buyers. 
We are learning, and trying constantly to add value for our users and the agents wherever we can through different touchpoints, enabling them to make the right choice while maintaining the best user experience.--JD--
We're looking for Full Stack Developers who are familiar with 
Ruby on Rails, HTML and Javascript.
If you've had experience with AWS, it will be a good bonus.
We currently only accept applicants who are either currently residing in Malaysia or who are Malaysian citizens. The option for remote work was there, but as a startup we don't have the luxury to resources and time to closely monitor tech. We prefer that you'd be phisically present for the job.
--Our Culture-- 
We are a small family of dreamers, driven by the same vision: to bring on positive changes to the property industry. 
As a team, our strength lies into our diversity of backgrounds, interests and cultures. We work in an open office environment, which fosters interactions and fast paced decisions. 
We favor ability and a can-do mindset over experience and degrees.

Pathlight | Software Engineers | SF | full-time | onsite | https://pathlight.com
Pathlight (pathlight.com) was founded by two entrepreneurs who wanted to tackle a challenging and unsolved problem: managing people every day is really hard and no one has built software to help. After selling their last company to Yelp, they started noticing that managers in every department were struggling, regardless of how experienced they were. Engineering managers weren't able to flag, diagnose, and manage anomalous behavior. Sales and Customer Service managers had 20 tabs open in their browser just to figure out was going on. Every single one of them was reinventing the wheel and their teams were suffering because of it. After all, who hasn't had a bad or stressed or too busy manager?

Trey and Alex realized that, for the first time, there's enough data available for software to help intelligently manage people. The idea for Pathlight was born.

We're at this exciting inflection point – we've shipped product, have users that love us, and have just raised our Series A from a Top VC, but the team is still super small, with a lot of opportunity for ownership and leadership. Joining Pathlight now means becoming part of the founding team of engineers, each of whom will have a massive impact on the product, platform, engineering culture, and company itself.

Front-End: React, Redux

Back-End: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

We're pragmatic about using the right tool for the task at hand.

The dictionaries are a gift to each student to use at school and at home for years to come.

We're looking for an in-house developer to join a small team of 2-3 (plus some outside consultants) to help us with our rebuild of our website and its backend API and database, which helps us track donations and sponsorships around the country. We want to have everything moved over to a modern software stack following current best practices that will make our applications maintainable for years to come. There are plenty more projects on the horizon as well.

The legacy site was a custom MVC application and a WordPress installation on a WIMP stack, while the new site is being built on Magento and will be deployed on modern cloud infrastructure. We also have some code that runs on .NET and SQL Server, with an Angular 6 frontend, so experience with that is a plus.

Tierra (tierra.co) | Software Engineer | San Fransisco, CA/Mexico City | Remote | Full-time
Come make the world a safer place. Literally.

Imagine having all your day-to-day decisions dictated by a simple question – “Am I putting myself in danger? ” And then not having any real way to answer that question. Countries like Mexico are experiencing an unprecedented wave of crime and violence. The cost is real:

• 530 billion USD get spent in LATAM on safety and security; 9.4% of Mexico’s GDP

• ~6% of gross revenues for companies is spent on safety/crime prevention

• 8 people go missing per day in Mexico

• 40% of people have changed their habits due to safety concerns

At Tierra, we are working to empower those who are most at risk with the data to make their day-to-day lives safer. We are a team of previously successful entrepreneurs (Twitter, Google, Stripe) based in San Francisco working closely with both governments and corporates in Mexico to pool data and make it actionable.

We work with very large data sets that drive us to constantly improve our technical skills (ever tried to render 1 million data points on a Google map and suggest safe routes?)

We strongly believe (and have begun to prove) that it’s possible to make a real difference by applying technology to a problem that affects hundreds of millions of people on a daily basis. All of us feel a sense of urgency and passion to make the world a little safer.

Want to come join and make a difference? Get in touch: jobs@tierra.co
Full stack engineering position. Node.js, Python, and React stack.
Remote only – some of us spend time together in SF/Mexico City on a flexible basis.
Market compensation (both equity and cash). We are well funded.
Female led. Truly diverse and inclusive team.

Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/
Positions: Full-Stack Engineer, Data Scientists, R&D Product Formulator / Scientist
Overview: Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception of flavor, aroma, and texture to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products, enter new markets, and optimize their existing brands. We're a diverse 12 person post Series-A company.

Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, Java, GraphQL, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS

The Position(s)

_Data Science_: We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. Our Data Science team develops new models and algorithms from scratch to make second-order inference on sparse data sets from non-representative samples that generalizes to the underlying target population. We rely on cutting edge models such as persistent homology, PU Learning, and metric learning to make predictions on non-eucldian human sensory data. We don't use tensor flow or pandas or keras as they are not a good fit for our problem space. We prefer a deep understanding of math and stats VS experience running logistic regressions in Python. (but we're cool with Python / Logit / experience)

_Engineering_: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Data-Engineers with experiance in micro-batch processing for machine learning pipelines.
Next Steps: please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

InCountry is creating a new cloud infrastructure category - “data residency as a service”. As the internet’s regulatory landscape fractures around the globe, SaaS providers are increasing subject to strict controls regulating how and where certain information is stored. InCountry - founded by six-time founder Peter Yared -  is building a global, targeted storage and compute network which allows customers to transparently meet data regulations as they are changing around the world.
We are seeking senior engineers to join our team to work on a wide range of distributed systems and cloud infrastructure problems. We have technical challenges on a deep stack including: highly available systems and storage, cluster management, global networking, container orchestration, secure systems and key management, performance scaling and API design. Currently our stack is focused around Python and Postgres, but we will introduce Golang and Mongo DB to the stack this year.

Some key qualifications:
- Extensive experience with cloud infrastructure, either as a user or builder
- Experience up and down the stack
- You have carried the pager and operated web systems at scale
This is a chance to help build critical global infrastructure from the ground up. We are looking for people willing to code and mentor, but who can also write a great design spec. We are growing fast and working in a rapidly changing global landscape, so you should enjoy working fast in the face of ambiguity. The trade-off is autonomy, fast decisions, and big impact. Work wherever you want - InCountry is already a globally distributed team.
Headquarters is in SF, but we are globally distributed and encourage remote applicants.

Glowforge  |  glowforge.com  | Senior UI/UX Product Designer (Growth)  | Seattle, WA | Onsite | Full Time
Glowforge is a beautiful device that sits on your desk. It uses a laser to carve and engrave products from raw materials like wood, leather, acrylic – even cardboard.

If you haven’t already, check out our video on glowforge.com. While you’re there, you’ll notice something amazing: Glowforge is the largest crowdfunding campaign in history. There is incredible demand for what we’re creating. It’s not a geeky tool for the tech elite or a garage workshop; we’re crafting an iconic product that is going to change the way people think about creativity. Our customers include consumers, digital designers, crafters, engineers, teachers, artists, and more.

Why We Need You?

Until now, maker tools have been excruciating to use. The software, the buying process, and the communication is shrouded in geek-code and insiderspeak.

Glowforge is different. We created a 3D laser printer that is simple enough that anyone can use it. And designers like you are the most inspiring customers of all. You can get a tiny taste of the talent and inspiration we’re talking about by looking at our customers’ work on https://instagram.com/explore/tags/glowforge/.

Our customers buy their Glowforge to create magic, but you are the one who makes that process magical. We need you to author the visual language that represents who we are, what we stand for, and the magic that we want to create in the world. It’s your design work that epitomizes the Glowforge experience, and we need you to be the best version of ourselves.

Sempo.ai | Full-Stack, Technical Lead | Melbourne, Australia | Full Time | ONSITE | https://sempo.ai
Sempo’s mission is to create open ecosystems that connect financially isolated communities with each other and the global economy.

Our primary use case is to help NGOs deliver Cash Aid directly to people affected by humanitarian crises. Why? Because 70% of Syrian refugees have sold the aid they've been given to buy what they actually need.

We’re addressing this this by building a financial platform that is accessible to people living in low connectivity environments with limited technical or financial exposure.

Since going live in September 2018, we've used our Ethereum based platform to help deliver cash aid to over 2500 vulnerable people in places like Iraqi Kurdistan, Lebanon,  Greece and Vanuatu.
Stack: Python/Flask, React & React Native, Docker, Solidity is a bonus.

Hack Club | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE | https://hackclub.com
Launched 3 years ago, Hack Club is a global network of student-led hacker clubs now spanning 315 high schools, 35 states, and 17 countries with an estimated 10,000 students impacted by our programs each year.

We’re looking to bring in a product-minded full stack engineer to own development and growth of Hack Club Bank (https://hackclub.com/bank/), which we launched on Hacker News four months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241).

Hack Club Bank is growing quickly, crossing $600K in transactions two weeks ago. You will have a founder-like engineering role and will work with our founder and Executive Director to flesh out the vision and strategy. You will lead the charge to get us to $6M in transactions over the next 12 months. The potential goes way beyond high school hackathons: it’s every US nonprofit with an annual budget of under ~$300K (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship).

The product is revenue generating, we’re a well-funded growing nonprofit that recently won the $1M Frank Foundation grant (https://grant.frank.ly/), and we have two major partnerships for HC Bank close to closing, but we need the right person to make them happen. These two partnerships would add an additional $4M in transactions over the next 12 months alone.
Interested? Email me at zach@hackclub.com with why you think you’d be a good fit for this role. About you: obsessive, product-minded, deeply technical, past experience with Rails and if not, able to learn.

• Do you care about delivering quality product to your users?

• Is providing maintainable, tested code to your fellow engineers (and future self) important to you?

• Do you have a deep understanding of Javascript and/or Python? Are you interested in the movement to a serverless infrastructure?

• When you encounter a problem that isn't neatly packaged and fully defined, are you passionate about digging into it and refining a solution?

If you can answer yes to these questions, you'll find working here exciting and engaging.

At United Income, we value collaboration. We encourage one another to build phenomenal things, and individually we’re all passionate about doing our best work. You'll be responsible for solving some hard problems in consumer finance. As you tackle these problems head on, you'll work with others across the company to make sure you have all the information you need.

Some of our engineering roles involve cool mathematical modeling. If you can engineer and you also have fun thinking about math, we have some opportunities for you that can be difficult to find in standard engineering jobs. We are committed to equal opportunity and diverse hiring. Even more important than hiring is supporting our diverse team, and we are dedicated to equitable pay and transparency.
As you know, this industry moves FAST. If you have 15 years of Node.js experience...well we think you’re lying ;) We don't expect you to be familiar with our entire tech stack (buzzwords: Javascript/Python/React/AWS/CI/CD/Git). What’s important is your willingness and ability to learn. We want to see your curiosity and passion for what’s out there.

ChartIQ | Electron Open-Source Developer - Full-Time Paid | C++ / JavaScript | Remote / Anywhere
"Basically what we're looking for is someone who can be our engineer, who works on and contributes to the electron project. Our Electron expert."

For example, Electron has a current, long-running bug which is critical for us but not critical for the community at large: #12027 (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12027). Fixing that bug requires that you understand Electron and its internals and hack at the underlying Chromium layer which is in C++.

This is an opportunity to be a full-time open-source contributor to the Electron project, as an employee with us at ChartIQ. You’ll be part of a product team. We rely on Electron; it’s a critical foundation to Finsemble, our platform for building enterprise HTML5 desktop applications. You’ll prioritize and implement improvements upstream to Electron, to support Finsemble in providing multi-application, multi-window deployments with interprocess communications that integrate otherwise disparate applications into a seamless unified experience.

About ChartIQ

ChartIQ (https://www.chartiq.com/) is a high-growth startup based in Charlottesville, Virginia, with $20M+ in Series B funding, offering the dynamism of a startup with the stability that comes with success. We build frameworks and libraries for enterprise developers. In other words, we build the tools for people who build things.

Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k
https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Abine Inc. | Privacy | Remote | Boston, MA
Abine Inc. provides online privacy software and services to consumers. We have hundreds of thousands of active daily users, and are looking to grow our team. If you care about privacy and security for the masses then come talk to us.
We are specifically looking for part and full time roles:

* DevOps & Sysadmin Engineers (especially with AWS experience). Ideally you'd have years of experience with Linux systems, done a great job implementing devlops workflows, but also care about the care and feeding and protection of all the infrastructure you touch.

Devops: https://abine.breezy.hr/p/9fcce0a83b58-devops-engineer-sysadmin

We are also looking for capable linux admins with less devops experience (but are capable) but who are skilled as systems and network security -- especially in cloud environments.

* Full stack engineer (from angular to RoR to bash to java and back again) to work with us on improving our privacy products across multiple platforms and languages.  To us "full-stack" means you can work on a system from end-to-end, and can apply CS knowledge and experience across specific languages and platforms appropriately.  Flexibility and quick learning is a must. Most of our code is client software so it helps if you've had to deal with client specific issues (e.g. dealing with long-tail distribution of client versions etc.)

Full-Stack: https://abine.breezy.hr/p/d5c9249c8227-contract-full-stack-engineer-remote

We are still a small team, so your work will have an immediate and real impact. You also won't be stuck with a routine - we touch many types of systems and problems, so raw capability is more important than direct experience. What can you do over what have you done is what matters most.

Cignition | Software Engineers: Full-Stack/Generalist; Machine Learning; Game Dev | San Mateo, CA, USA | FULL-TIME | ONSITE
Cignition is a small, growing, highly-collaborative education tech startup. We are looking for experienced software engineers for full-time positions, on-site in San Mateo. Compensation, stock options, and benefits are very competitive. We are not able to sponsor visas at this time.

Full-Stack/Generalist position: You should have enough real-world experience to demonstrate that you have good software fundamentals, you can pick up whatever is needed, and you can work independently and take ownership in our small team of engineers. You would work on back-end and front-end development, data analysis, AWS dev ops, and overall system architecture. We currently use Python/Flask/MongoDB on AWS, though you would get to decide future directions. Prior experience with any of these technologies is a plus, but we trust that you can learn anything you don't already know. You would also participate in defining the vision for our offerings.

This is to replace me as I head back to grad school. Our other engineer is primarily focused on game development, though he is super-sharp and shares the load for non-game work as well.

We are also looking for a second game dev, as well as a machine learning expert.  The lines between these roles could blur if we find the right people.

Cignition is passionate about blending the arts and sciences of gameplay, teaching, and neuroscience to create immersive learning experiences for children. Our game, FogStone Isle, is loved by teachers, parents, and children. We're also launching an online micro-tutoring service which dovetails with our game (currently in trials in low-income schools). We believe in the importance of measuring the efficacy of our offerings, with a focus on improving students' conceptual understanding. This is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a growing team that is developing a truly original series of games and interactive experiences.
Contact: jobs+hn@cignition.com

Hazel Analytics | Data Scientist | Seattle, WA | ONSITE | $100K - $150K + 0.05% - 1% equity (DOE) | https://hazelanalytics.com
Hazel Analytics is a fast-growing food tech company on a mission to create innovative products that change the way organizations use food safety data. Founded in 2014 by professors from Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Maryland, we're the proven market leader in health department data analytics, serving Amazon, Cheesecake Factory, Chick-fil-A, Starbucks, Subway, Target, Whole Foods, and more — nearly half of the largest 100 food retail chains. Our platform transforms diffuse and disparate local health department data into actionable operational intelligence for our customers, who need to proactively monitor food safety and regulatory compliance while serving millions of meals every day. In recognition of our impact, we're a proud recipient of the Food Marketing Institute's Food Safety Innovation Award (2019) and Jack in the Box's Food Safety Innovation Award (2016).

We're currently seeking a data scientist who will help identify new opportunities and develop high-impact data analytics, predictive models, and statistical tools for our user community. You'll be expected to be both a creative and critical thinker, to have strong judgment in prioritization and execution, and to strike a balance between moving quickly and delivering high-trust analytics. You'll need to not only think and act like a leader but also roll up your sleeves and deliver production-ready models. Our tech stack predominantly features Python and R, but your input will be instrumental in further defining our architecture.

We're profitable and privately-held (i.e. no VC investors), which means your equity is worth something from day one, and you’ll be able to make a direct impact on the company's strategy and execution. Personally, I was hired from a HN job thread — I'm looking forward to seeing some great HN applicants!
Apply here: https://jobs.lever.co/hazelanalytics/92c19146-aace-4a87-ad17-9bab28c4faa1?lever-origin=applied&lever-source%5B%5D=Hacker%20News

Zeal | Experienced Full Stack Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE
W2 and Contractor options available.

Zeal is a software consultancy. We work with a variety of companies, of varying sizes, and in various vertical markets. In every case our ultimate goal is to have them finish up feeling like they got more than they paid for.

That means that we have a great variety of projects for you to work on, with different challenges, and different business benefits to the client. This job is perfect for someone who gets tired of working on the same old thing all the time, and wants to be able to change it up sometimes.

Right now, we're specifically looking for experienced software developers who have worked on Rails back-end / React front-end or Node back-end / React front-end applications.

Our interview process is simple, and transparent.

1. As soon as you apply you'll get an email confirming that we got your application.

2. Someone reviews your application for some basic requirements (which are also listed on the application).

3. Next you'll have a short interview with someone, likely our Director of Consulting. This won't take more than 30 minutes.

4. After that we want to get some code to work on. We have a homework project you can use, or you can bring your own project as long as it includes Rails and React, or Node and React (depends on the position you're applying for). And it needs to be on your machine and ready to work on, because that's what we'll do together. If you use our homework, please timebox the task to no more than 2 hours.

5. Once you've got a project we can work on together, we'll schedule 2 back-to-back interviews with our engineers. 1 engineer in each interview. This won't take more than 90 minutes total.

6. After that, we review the feedback from the engineers, check your references, and extend an offer if we both agree it makes sense.

We hope you choose to apply. We'd love to get to know you.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, a year ago I moved Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. More here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

The work will include: Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK.
Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud and include a direct link to an open source contribution you've made, or an issue you've logged, no matter how small. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Everyone complains that our healthcare system is inefficient and costly. If the idea of working with smart people to actually solve the problem and make it significantly better for our future generations seems worth your time, reach out to me directly at sanjeev.a@leantaas.com and I'll put you in touch with the right hiring manager.

We're a Series C funded healthcare tech company based in Silicon Valley obsessed about making our hospitals more efficient with data science and machine learning. 65+ healthcare organizations including the likes of Stanford, Duke, NYP, Dignity, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Tenet and more rely on our products to lower patient wait times, improve staff satisfaction and overall financial performance.

Our team includes successful entrepreneurs, engineers, product managers and data scientists from Google, LinkedIn, Apple, Symantec MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Google, McKinsey, and more. We've raised $55 million to date from top tier VCs in Silicon Valley. CBInsights recently named us among the top 100 AI companies in the world.

On the data engineering side, our stack is Airflow/Python. On the web services side, our stack is Java/Play and Angular 2/Typescript. We're fully cloud hosted on AWS and leverage modern tooling and automation to produce high quality code - and we ship every week!
Our vision is to build an "Air Traffic Control" for hospitals - a centralized command and control center that routes the right information to the right department as patients flow through the system - if we get that right, we'll be able to significantly make our hospitals more efficient and eliminate waiting and wastage and solve the problem once and for all.

Everactive | Data Scientist | Ann Arbor, MI | Full-time, ONSITE
Everactive (formerly PsiKick) is an industrial internet-of-things (IIOT) company that creates energy-harvesting batteryless sensors to monitor industrial equipment like steam traps and motors. Our founding team invented the lowest-power wake-up radios on the market, and we complement that IP with a full-stack solution spanning hardware, software, and analytics. We've got amazing investors and a long runway, and we're a platform that will scale to millions of sensors.

I'm looking for a Data Scientist to join me in our Ann Arbor office as the second member of the Data team. We're working to detect and predict state changes in the equipment we monitor. I'm focusing on the data infrastructure and pipeline and need help with the algorithmic state detection and building tools to help in-house domain experts to annotate our data as efficiently as possible. Our core sensor outputs are stationary time series, and several unique aspects mean we need creative solutions beyond standard ML and forecasting approaches.

As the second member of the team you will have significant input into how the data team operates and continues to grow. I'm looking for someone with several years industry experience and strong opinions about the right way to do things, including technology (tools, libraries) and process (workflow, hiring).

I work primarily in Python (numpy/pandas/etc) with some R (tidyverse, Shiny) and deploy to AWS with Docker (ECS, EKS). I'm parallel to (not within) the software team who also uses a lot of go and typescript. We love Postgres, are adopting Gitlab (including CI/CD), and are experimenting with Timescale, Pachyderm, Hasura, and others.

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Experience in the following is a plus:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

Language experience: any logic/constraint language (required), C / C++ (plus)

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Quill.org | Software Engineer | New York, NY | ONSITE, SALARY: 70k-120k
React / Ruby / Rails / Python / Machine Learning

At Quill.org, we’ve created an online learning platform to help middle school students, primarily lower income ones, improve their reading and writing ability. Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.

Some info about Quill.org:
- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers
- We served over 1 million students last year and are continuing to grow.
- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts.
- We’ve been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to name a few.
As a member of our engineering team, you will be directly involved in building tools for students, teachers, and administrators. We are looking for developers who can take features from a user story to production. We are a rapidly-growing team of 13 working in the Financial District of New York City.

TalkJS | REMOTE (Europe only) or ONSITE (Eindhoven, Netherlands) | https://talkjs.com
TalkJS lets developers build custom chat features in hours instead of months. We're product driven and we power communication inside online marketplaces, community sites, trading platforms and so on.

-- ONLINE MARKETER --

Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing to the point that we have no time left to work on the funnel that drives this demand. This is a luxury problem, which we intend to solve with full force with the help of you, an experienced online marketer with a passion for technical products. We're looking for someone who:


    * Has demonstrable experience growing B2B SaaS inbound
    * Has sufficient tech skills to set up analytics pipelines 
    * Proactively iterates and experiments
    * Can write
    * Wants to jump on a rocket ship that's just taking off²

Bonus points if you can code a bit. We offer you an opportunity to start, build, and lead our marketing team as we grow. Significant equity is on the table, as well as the chance to work in a great collaborative, open, and constructive distributed team culture.
Apply by sending an email to hey@talkjs.com. Mention something you've helped grow and include something you've written. This can be anything that shows your ability to enthuse: a blog post or a landing page or even a flyer for the local christmas fair.

²) I'm well aware that this is a platitude, but in our case it's really quite true and it wasn't half a year ago. We're blowing up and we need your help :-)

-- MOBILE DEVELOPER WHO LOVES API DESIGN --

TalkJS is currently focused on the web and that's just not good enough. Easy to use APIs and SDKs are the key to our success on the web, and we're looking to do this natively on mobile as well. We could use your help with that.

If you're an experienced developer who's good at coming up with Java and Swift APIs that Android/iOS devs love to use, then get in touch. We don't have the job opening published yet, so just email to hey@talkjs.com. Bonus points if you can show us an API you designed (on any platform).

Like the marketing job, this is remote (Europe) or on-site in Eindhoven, NL. ⠀
No recruiters or agencies, please.

Flow integrates into existing e-commerce platforms and provides brands with a high degree of flexibility over all aspects of the customer experience (local currency pricing, duty & tax calculation, local merchandising), local checkout (local payment methods, local language) and cheap/fast international shipping options resulting in steep growth in international sales.

Our dream is to remove borders from global commerce. We are building a point-to-point global eCommerce platform that enables brands to expand internationally. We help brands with everything from catalog management, pricing, currency risk, payment processing, to logistics.

The business was founded by Mike Bryzek (co-founder/CTO of e-commerce giant, Gilt Groupe) and Rob (founder/CEO of leader in customer experience, Fizzback).

Our approach to software is pretty unique and offers great opportunities to learn. We are a microservices architecture (Scala backends, ReactJS frontends), practice API-first software development, and run continuous delivery (merging a PR deploys the change).

Hello fellow hackers and direct employers!
…I am sick of agencies and HR portals etc. All I  ended up was waste of time jumping through the circus hoops, while the only beneficiary was probably the agency who farmed resumes to sell them to some other client like the CDOs in Finance...

I am a largely self-taught, very highly motivated and the non-pedant efficiency-loving programmer since 2015 (Python, Rust, Julia mainly, but can learn fast), and since you are all talking about job offers, I want to ask for your opinion:

Would you hire a graduate of the www.launchschool.com ? I am contemplating solidifying my programming by blazing through their program since I have slow-learned code for 4 years, so I would not be a typical "studious beginner". I just want to fill some gaps as well as be able to ameliorate the word "self-taught" by adding Launchschool and its projects to my resume.

Any thoughts? Thank you for your valuable advice.
James Logari

We therefore pursue this project with the hope and convinction that it will: 
- unlock opportunities for millions to have more control and creativity with respect to how they raise, share, transfer, coordinate and distribute wealth 
- empower more users and developers to make the web a space and tool that is defined by collaboration, consent, privacy, security, synergy and freedom

- lead the development of front end features 
- facilitate growth of open source community contributions to MetaMask

Hi! I’m looking for a technical person to work with me on an early stage startup.
I’m building a system which invests startups' cash reserves in safe, highly liquid money market funds which yield over two percent annual interest, allowing them to grow their reserves without compromising access to funds. Furthermore, the system integrates checking accounts which allow startups to process transactions quickly and easily, and offers an intuitive online interface which allows them to track their progress through key metrics such as net cash flow, burn rate, and predicted runway.

We’re just beginning development so you have the ability to make a real impact on our systems and work in an agile environment.

Experience with building web applications with complex interfaces, backend systems, and security is important. Languages to know include frontend ones such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and JQuery, as well as backend ones such as PHP, Java, and C++. We’re flexible with the exact languages you know but you should be able to build complex web apps which can handle a large user base.

Experience with building highly secure systems is very important, since this is a financial services system potentially holding millions of dollars and therefore having serious consequences if hacked.

Ability to work quickly while still doing amazing work is also super important. Some people can get the job done by a deadline, but it’s not clean code. Others can write clean code but not meet the deadline. I’m looking for someone who can write beautiful code and beat the deadline doing it.

Do things which leave me wondering how it was even possible for you to do them. Surprise me, in the best possible way.

With every person I add to the team, I’m looking for someone smarter than anyone already on it. Basically, each new team member increases the average individual intelligence level of the team. I’m looking forward to working with people who meet and exceed that bar!

We are based in the Houston area. Local programmers are preferred but remote is perfectly acceptable.

Interns, students, etc. are very welcome. This is a very early stage company so compensation would be a significant amount of equity rather than cash, so I don’t expect people with cash obligations to work here full time (but feel free to contact me to work on this as a side project).

This is almost a cofounder role. You get to build a great company here, while doing great technical work.

You can reach me at ashutoshraiofficial@gmail.com.
Looking forward to working with the best and the brightest!

Tech Stack: Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (all levels) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

We're the fastest growing unicorn you've never heard of [0] and was just recently named CNBCs Most Disruptive Business beating out Airbnb, Stripe, Flexport, and more [3].

Indigo is revolutionizing agtech by offering better crops to farmers through technology. Agtech is one of the most underhyped technology trends [1] and we're serving a multi-trillion dollar marketplace services industry [2].

Our group is working on the Uber for Agriculture. We're developing a Transportation network to connect farmers with preferred carriers (trucks) to help them ship millions of bushels of grain across the United States. It's like a real world Traveling Salesman Problem with even more requirements.

We're growing so fast that I have to hire another 10 engineers just for my group in 2019. Back-end, front-end, mobile... you name it, we need the help (see all of them here: https://www.indigoag.com/join-us ).

Our tech stack includes AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (DevOps), Postgres (DB), Node & GraphQL (back-end), React & Apollo (front-end), and Python (data science / comp bio).

We also offer incredible perks. Free lunch (a rarity in Boston), massive commuter benefits (both MBTA and bicycling), fitness reimbursement, ample vacation; we really focus on and believe in both health and sustainability.

I'd be happy to tell you more, so feel free to PM me and I'll personally refer you to the company.

Manulife University | Int & Sr Software Engineer | 85K – 150K + Annual bonus up to 14% of salary | Waterloo & Montreal | ON-SITE | Full-time
Want to redefine enterprise education and help transform a global giant in the insurance/financial services industry?

Manulife (https://www.manulife.com) is investing heavily in continuous learning for its workforce and we are looking for talented software engineers to join our Manulife University team to teach, inspire and invent.  Manulife University or MU, as we like to call it, behaves very much like an educational institution, but within a corporate environment. We have onsite classrooms in multiple continents and MU students are expected to do nothing but learn while in class, which means no day to day distractions like team meetings, emails and so forth.

For four weeks straight, five days a week, eight hours a day, we teach students how to create microservice applications with NodeJS, how to create front-end apps with React and Redux, and much more.  And if you are wondering what our curriculum currently looks like, the following is just some of the modern technologies that we teach:

JavaScript (ES6), React, Redux, NodeJS, GraphQL, and Microservice Architecture

We are also always looking for new technologies and methodologies to teach, which will allow us to stay competitive and to attract/retain talent.  With MU, we are unlocking the secrets for how we can provide continuous learning at scale, that can be done in a way that makes business sense.  There are still a lot of challenges ahead of us and new technologies and processes that will need to be invented, but the future looks bright for continuous learning.

In the future we can see employees not only negotiating for vacation days, but for education days as well.  What we are trying to do with MU is truly ambitious, but we need talented software engineers with an entrepreneurial spirit, that can speak with credibility, confidence and humility, to help us make this happen.  If you are the type of software engineer that sees problems as opportunities and can speak with confidence in-front of one or a hundred, we’d love to hear from you.

We know we are not in the same tech league as giants like Google or Amazon, but we can offer you an opportunity that they can’t.  What they can’t do is provide you with an opportunity to help redefine enterprise education and transform a global giant with close to one trillion dollars in assets.  By joining the MU team, you’ll have a once in a life-time opportunity to help pioneer a new way of learning and teaching in enterprise, that can redefine how we work in the future.

Lightning Labs | Frontend Developer, Crypto Protocol Engineer, Dev Ops, Infrastructure | San Francisco | Onsite or Remote | Full-time
https://angel.co/lightning/ https://lightning.engineering/

Lightning Labs is hiring! We’re looking to expand our team to build technology that scales Bitcoin and blockchains. Our current focus is the development and deployment of the Lightning Network, an open blockchain scalability protocol. We push the edge of innovation with regard to blockchain scalability, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX. If you’re interested in one of the positions below, please send a brief description of your relevant experience and resume/github to jobs@lightning.engineering. And if you know someone who might be a good fit, we'd very much appreciate any referrals.

{Crypto Protocol Engineer}:

Experienced systems software engineer versed in applied cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems, open source software, and cryptocurrency protocols to design and implement core protocol and algorithmic components of the Lightning Network. Solid programming skills, experience with Go, C, or C++. Prior contributions to crypto protocols and open source software collaboration preferred.

{Frontend Application Developer}:

Frontend developer to build secure cross-platform second-layer blockchain applications.

Paystack (YC W16) | Software/Cloud Engineers, Hiring/Training/Agile Leads | Nigeria | Full-time | Remote | https://paystack.com/engineering
Paystack helps businesses in Africa get paid by anyone, anywhere in the world. We raised a Series A from Stripe and Visa and are a growing team of 77 friends (21 engineers) with a mission to accelerate digital commerce in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

We're expanding across Africa and have people from as far as Canada, France, and Turkey. We help relocate anyone interested to where our offices are, but we're also determined about remote. Due to rapid growth, half of us are remote today.

One specific occasion we do require our people to be present at is our quarterly off-site. Four times a year, we fly you in for an extended weekend of jam-packed fun and company-wide check-in, and should you opt for extending your stay a little bit, we host you at our guest house or a sweet hotel. Here’re a few photos from our Q3 offsite (https://bit.ly/2GkPcZx)

We enjoy a close relationship with some of the most interesting technology companies in the world. GitHub CEO Nat Friedman recently swung by our Lagos office (https://bit.ly/2xLmGLy) and we also hosted teams from Stripe (https://bit.ly/2XGxK7m)

Our engineering has independent infrastructure, frontend, and (multiple) backend teams that work closely with product, growth, and business. We deploy JavaScript on AWS, data on MySQL, maintain some legacy PHP alongside small Java services.

We're making great efforts to modularize and improve the quality of our codebases on a quest to embrace asynchronous processing and independent microservices on cloud-agnostic infrastructure.

We're very proud of our product, and we made a promise to ourselves to make our codebase a thing of envy.

So here's what we need; people better than us in every way.

We're a tight bunch of curious people hungry for experienced colleagues to take us to the next level. We crave highly skilled, kind teammates who hold themselves to high standards, and care as fiercely as we do about pursuing collective growth and learning.

A challenge to build a payments growth engine for an entire continent does not come often. It's an especially interesting time to join Paystack.

Our hiring is not very conventional and we try to personalize it. We mainly rely on working together on a sample, fictitious project. We'll recognize experience, insatiable curiosity, and an immense passion for sharing.
My name is Serkan. I myself have joined Paystack only 8 months ago when we were less than 35 people and have been leading engineering for the past 3 months from my home in Turkey. Please don't hesitate to reach me at serkan@paystack.com and let's begin chatting.

Getaway | Brooklyn, NY (or close by, able to drop in twice a month) | Back End Developer, Rails | Full-Time | Onsite (or nearby) | https://getaway.house
If you’re reading this job description, you’re probably someone that spends a lot of time on the computer and the internet. Although we at Getaway leverage these tools like any other business does, our product seeks to physically take our customers away from these things in an effort to find the magic and relaxation they’ve so desperately been seeking. We’re putting tiny houses on camp sites in remote locations so our “users” can get away and set up a high-speed interface with their humanity. We create and maintain technology that, in some cases invisibly, enables a mystical experience for our guests and removes stress from their lives!

Getaway is a small but rapidly growing team that just raised a $22.5M Series B financing round. Our offices our located in Downtown Brooklyn but we are open to semi-remote candidates that can visit our offices at least twice a month.
The Back End Developer will focus on the following areas:
- Building new features for and maintaining the current functionality of our website, written  with a Ruby on Rails back end and a React/SASS front end, in a semi-agile working environment
- Brainstorming and iterating on existing features, with some projects in the next few months including a new accounts portal for our guests, a new financial data analysis software to be built, and ensuring our site can handle more traffic as we scale
- Some minor developer operations tasks ensuring the website is serving our customers well and performing to our expectations - we’re hosted currently on Heroku
- Supporting the cabin automation effort, working on software to make the guest experience seamless and magical, including work on our house door lock automation software and leak sensors, for instance. This is mostly written in Ruby and Groovy, soon moving to all Python and Ruby
- Writing internal tools to support our Guest Experience team and make it extremely easy for guests to get the things they need to have a wonderful time on their Getaways
- Continuing to find efficiencies and ways to leverage software to improve our team’s workflows and the way we do business
- Occasionally writing code in front of a fire, if you so desire (for real!)
We’re looking for someone with around 2 years of experience but don’t want anyone to shy away from applying if they think they’re a real “rockstar/ninja/etc”. This is not a junior development role and those straight out of school or bootcamp need not apply, unfortunately we just don’t have the resources to support such a candidate at this time.
Interested developers should send a short cover letter and resume to jobs@getaway.house, subject line, “Back End Developer Role”.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

In particular, we are looking for a number of IT Professionals with active Top Secret or Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance (TS or TS/SCI) in support of one of our Federal customers in the Ft. Meade area: https://www.tanium.com/apply-now/?gh_jid=1610524&gh_src=d2f26a7e1

Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Colorado Springs, Fort Meade, Quantico, Reston, San Antonio, or Washington D.C.:

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

TAM roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support. We're currently looking for folks in a number of US cities as well as Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, or Switzerland.

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Technical%20Account%20Management&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

Director of Strategic Accounts - We're looking for a number of sales people to fill various roles including, in particular, Director of Strategic Accounts.

These are primarily remote roles, looking for people based in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and the UK.

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions (in no particular order of preference):

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or AzureDevOps is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: I don't find it acceptable if you would accept this as part-time job while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with side-projects or other one single extra part-time job.
