Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because:
- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.
- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Kubernetes, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Kalepa | Machine Learning Engineers, Backend / Data Engineers, Full-Stack Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Me | part time backend node dev | Sydney | Onsite
I've got an open room in a penthouse on the beach in Sydney. Essentially I'd like you to come live in it for free and work part time on one of my open source side projects. This is the view you'd wake up to: https://i.imgur.com/3TiTwBp.jpg and the view from the other side of the apartment: https://i.imgur.com/7c3D4En.jpg . It's not bad. I've got surfboards if as well if you're into that, and the snorkeling just out front is some of the best in Sydney: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKrdldogMLw

Position is from now until March. Three days a week on my project gets you a free room and free food.

About the project itself: Creating a Patreon meets Reddit kinda site. User pays $5/mo, we take $1 to run the servers without ads or tracking, then the remaining $4 gets split evenly between everything they upvoted that month. Philosphies I'm going into this with: Entirely open source, no ads ever, all analytics are purely opt-in. I'm a front end guy and right now I'm grinding my gears with the backend, so anyone that can create node apis secured with JWTs is really who I need.
If you're interested hit me up at j at jjcm.org

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning through software and cutting-edge analytics leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

Waive | Los Angeles LA Hollywood | Fullstack PHP Python Product Automotive Mechanical Electrical Engineer | Onsite - Full-Time | DoE
We're a (mostly) electric urban mobility company founded in 2015, a bit before the current wave of them being everywhere.

I'm running a team of 3 engineers and am looking for a few more at our family-sized company which may be doing some scaling soon.  We have tens of thousands of customers, millions in assets, it's a real thing.

There's a few innovative products in here somewhere and I'm being a bit guarded because there's more than one company with tens of millions in funding who had us multiple times in their pitch deck (one just closed another $30 million last week, splendid).

Anyway, we were on Shark Tank in 2016 and have done a couple iterations of the product since then. We just did a major pivot on May 1st.

Here's our plan for the next year or so, listed in order (highest first):
* A new ad platform for our screens (a version we're going to throw away is at waivescreen.com)
 * An on-demand gig economy car (see maven, envoy, hyrecar, and getaround for imho, poorly executed examples). This includes
    * backoffice work (currently in node but new stuff can be in whatever)
    * a new app or some other kind of smartphone presence (stability and Donald-Norman style UX as opposed to art-school UX is all I care about)
 * New innovative ad tech (see firefly, grabbit, blip, adomni, etc)
 * Open-architecture, open platform telematics that don't suck (see invers & vulog)
This may sound a bit ambitious but really a lamp developer who has read a couple marketing books would be just fine.

So just email me already at chris@waive.car ... you've already made it this far.
Please include a sample of your work.

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.

Tray.io | London | Engineering Manager / Backend / Frontend | Full-time | Onsite | https://tray.io
There’s an app out there for everything but most cloud software services are distinctively difficult to use together, and doing so is very labour intensive. With our cutting-edge platform, processes that took hours, or even days, can now happen in seconds.

We want to give the power of technology back to the everyday user. At its core, Tray is a visual programming tool for APIs. It’s a low-code user experience that allows anyone to precisely instrument the data flow between SaaS tools. We’re creating a world of citizen automators with a drag & drop interface and enterprise grade architecture.

Customers like Reddit, NPM, Digital Ocean, GitHub, Lyft, and IBM are already reinventing how they work through Tray. Help us usher in the era of automation.

Tray.io is growing fast, after tripling our ARR and headcount year on year, the entertipse-class system we’ve built is reaching new technical heights and our gifted teams are becoming saturated. We are using the $37M Series B we’ve just been awarded to invest in creating comprehensive and intimate support, progression and technical frameworks for our multidisciplinary Product & Engineering teams. Read about our funding round here: https://tcrn.ch/2vtf4wi

We are small and dynamic, open to new ideas and the work you do now will have a big impact on shaping how we grow and fine-tune our highly performant multi-billion transaction platform for years to come.
