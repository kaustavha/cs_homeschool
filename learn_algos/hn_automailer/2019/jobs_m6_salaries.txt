Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.
One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning through software and cutting-edge analytics leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Launched 3 years ago, Hack Club is a global network of student-led hacker clubs now spanning 315 high schools, 35 states, and 17 countries with an estimated 10,000 students impacted by our programs each year.

We’re looking to bring in a product-minded full stack engineer to own development and growth of Hack Club Bank (https://hackclub.com/bank/), which we launched on Hacker News four months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241).

Hack Club Bank is growing quickly, crossing $600K in transactions two weeks ago. You will have a founder-like engineering role and will work with our founder and Executive Director to flesh out the vision and strategy. You will lead the charge to get us to $6M in transactions over the next 12 months. The potential goes way beyond high school hackathons: it’s every US nonprofit with an annual budget of under ~$300K (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship).

ChartIQ | Electron Open-Source Developer - Full-Time Paid | C++ / JavaScript | Remote / Anywhere
"Basically what we're looking for is someone who can be our engineer, who works on and contributes to the electron project. Our Electron expert."

For example, Electron has a current, long-running bug which is critical for us but not critical for the community at large: #12027 (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12027). Fixing that bug requires that you understand Electron and its internals and hack at the underlying Chromium layer which is in C++.

This is an opportunity to be a full-time open-source contributor to the Electron project, as an employee with us at ChartIQ. You’ll be part of a product team. We rely on Electron; it’s a critical foundation to Finsemble, our platform for building enterprise HTML5 desktop applications. You’ll prioritize and implement improvements upstream to Electron, to support Finsemble in providing multi-application, multi-window deployments with interprocess communications that integrate otherwise disparate applications into a seamless unified experience.

About ChartIQ

ChartIQ (https://www.chartiq.com/) is a high-growth startup based in Charlottesville, Virginia, with $20M+ in Series B funding, offering the dynamism of a startup with the stability that comes with success. We build frameworks and libraries for enterprise developers. In other words, we build the tools for people who build things. For USA-based employees, we offer very competitive salaries, medical/dental/vision coverage, generous vacation time, and flexible work hours.

Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k
https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Getaway | Brooklyn, NY (or close by, able to drop in twice a month) | Back End Developer, Rails | Full-Time | Onsite (or nearby) | https://getaway.house
If you’re reading this job description, you’re probably someone that spends a lot of time on the computer and the internet. Although we at Getaway leverage these tools like any other business does, our product seeks to physically take our customers away from these things in an effort to find the magic and relaxation they’ve so desperately been seeking. We’re putting tiny houses on camp sites in remote locations so our “users” can get away and set up a high-speed interface with their humanity. We create and maintain technology that, in some cases invisibly, enables a mystical experience for our guests and removes stress from their lives!

Getaway is a small but rapidly growing team that just raised a $22.5M Series B financing round. Our offices our located in Downtown Brooklyn but we are open to semi-remote candidates that can visit our offices at least twice a month.
The Back End Developer will focus on the following areas:
- Building new features for and maintaining the current functionality of our website, written  with a Ruby on Rails back end and a React/SASS front end, in a semi-agile working environment
- Brainstorming and iterating on existing features, with some projects in the next few months including a new accounts portal for our guests, a new financial data analysis software to be built, and ensuring our site can handle more traffic as we scale
- Some minor developer operations tasks ensuring the website is serving our customers well and performing to our expectations - we’re hosted currently on Heroku
- Supporting the cabin automation effort, working on software to make the guest experience seamless and magical, including work on our house door lock automation software and leak sensors, for instance. This is mostly written in Ruby and Groovy, soon moving to all Python and Ruby
- Writing internal tools to support our Guest Experience team and make it extremely easy for guests to get the things they need to have a wonderful time on their Getaways
- Continuing to find efficiencies and ways to leverage software to improve our team’s workflows and the way we do business
- Occasionally writing code in front of a fire, if you so desire (for real!)
We’re looking for someone with around 2 years of experience but don’t want anyone to shy away from applying if they think they’re a real “rockstar/ninja/etc”. This is not a junior development role and those straight out of school or bootcamp need not apply, unfortunately we just don’t have the resources to support such a candidate at this time.
Interested developers should send a short cover letter and resume to jobs@getaway.house, subject line, “Back End Developer Role”.

https://www.rxrx.ai/

We have raised over $80M to apply machine learning to one of the most unique datasets in existence - over 12 billion images of cells under a huge number of biological and chemical perturbations, generated in our own labs - in order to find treatments for hundreds of diseases. Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies.

* ML Researcher: Looking for a highly experienced senior/principal-level Machine Learning Researcher who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.

* ML Engineer: Looking for experienced Machine Learning Engineer who values experimentation and the rigorous use of the scientific method, high collaboration across multiple functions, and intense curiosity driving them to keep our systems cutting edge.
Additional roles we are hiring for: 
* Biologist, Computational Chemists, Automation Engineer, and Drug Discovery experts.
