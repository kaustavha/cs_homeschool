Kalepa | Machine Learning Engineers, Backend / Data Engineers, Full-Stack Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA
FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!
Please submit via our jobs page: https://www.fullstory.com/jobs/ . And feel free to drop me a note if you have any questions: dk@fullstory.com

Command E | Senior Software Engineer (engineer #2) | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE (North America only)
Hi HN! I'm the Founder & CTO of Command E…a lightning-fast, secure way to instantly find anything in the cloud with a simple keyboard shortcut. We're building a desktop app (Electron/React/Redux/SQLite) that syncs cloud data locally to your laptop and provides a Spotlight-like search & command interface on top of your cloud data.

Command E is basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data. It's inspired by the "fuzzy finder" search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, ⌘T in Atom, ⌘P in VSCode, etc.). The app has a lot of polish and a very clean, simple design. We already support many enterprise and consumer cloud services (Salesforce, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Asana, Trello, 15+ more).

We're a small team of 3 Silicon Valley veterans, well-capitalized by top Silicon Valley VC firms + angel investors. Both co-founders are engineers who worked at a VC firm, Eventbrite, and Digg. Our office is at 2nd and Market in San Francisco.
We're looking to hire 2 senior/core engineers. You'll be building a top-notch Silicon Valley company with experienced founders going after a massive market: search. Electron experience (or desire) is a big plus, but we're open to other backgrounds too. My co-founder and I met ~5 years ago through a "Who's Hiring" thread so we're excited to see who responds to this one - please email me at ben@getcommande.com if you’re interested.

BuySellAds (https://buysellads.com) | Fully REMOTE (US timezones strongly preferred)
We’re looking for an integration engineer with ad tech experience who wants to make ad tech a little less crappy
About us: 
BuySellAds operates the largest self-serve advertising marketplace on the web. We're an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently. Don’t let the "adtech" part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.
Dribbble, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft Azure, Slack, Digital Ocean, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.

We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 49 people spread out across 25 cities in 5 countries. We primarily use Rails and React, with a smattering of Go and PHP, but seek to hire developers who are language agnostic and are more interested in shipping quality code than bikeshedding it.
Interested? Send an email to dev+q2@buysellads.com (or ping me directly, firstname@) with some details on your background and what interests you about working with us.

It is very satisfying and fun work!

We are looking for Senior and Lead Fullstack Developers excited about building great software products, who are great teammates, and who are passionate about continuously refining best practices for creating successful digital products.  Experience in dev team leadership, new product development, collaboration with business and design stakeholders, and consulting experience are all a huge plus. Specific skills ideally include our favorite stack (at least very interested in learning) plus (nice to have) expertise in one of .NET/C#, iOS/Swift, or Android/Kotlin. We work remotely but occasional travel to San Francisco and other locations is part of the job for project kickoffs and other critical collaboration phases or meetings.
Interested? We want to hear from you! Please send resume/CV or LinkedIn to jobs@blackbird.us.  I am a founder so ask me anything! If there are other aspects of what we do that interest you definitely still hit me up!

Repod | Mobile Engineer (React Native + iOS + Android) | Full-Time | Remote | San Diego
At Repod, our goal is to empower people to discover, listen, and share great podcasts. Podcasts are unique in that they inspire us, help us learn something new, or captivate us with the way stories are told. Yet, all of these experiences are rarely shared with one another. By connecting people with an easy way to share and discuss podcasts, Repod helps people find and listen to great podcasts.

Currently, we are a two person team (2 cofounders) and are looking for our 1st full-time team member by way of mobile engineer. We are in the midst of a public beta and will be launching in the near future.

As the lead mobile engineer at Repod, you'll initially be working in our main repo developing and launching new features. Repod is built using React Native and relies heavily on a native audio player built in Swift/Java. As we expand our product, you’ll help inform the technologies used in our future growth. The team is small, which means your impact on the company’s success will be instrumental.

We have one requirement — must love podcasts.

Neos | London, UK / Brighton, UK / Partial remote | Full-time | https://neos.co.uk
Neos are an insurance company, making use of IoT devices to prevent issues before they turn into a claim, and give people peace of mind that their home is alright. We also have B2B deals with several major insurance companies, including Aviva in the UK, ANWB in the Netherlands, and American Family in the US to provide our IoT platform as a part of their insurance policies. Finally, we do direct retail sales of our camera to the public.

That's quite a lot to get done, so we're looking for Ruby developers to join the team. Depending on your experience and interests you'd either be working with the insurance team, looking after our policy admin and sales systems for direct insurance sales, or the IoT team who are responsible for device integration, B2B support, and providing APIs for our mobile apps to integrate with.

We've got a micro (but not too micro) service based architecture, which makes heavy use of AWS services such as SQS and SNS to ensure one part of the system failing doesn't take everything else down with it. Experience with distributed systems would definitely be a plus, especially in the IoT side of things where when we say "distributed" we mean "thousands of devices scattered around the world, on potentially unreliable internet connections". You'll get used to eventual consistency fast!

We're looking for people who are able to work out of either our London or Brighton office for at least some of the week. Most of team work remotely on a regular basis, and we're well set up to make that work - all our meeting rooms are set up to make people joining remotely easy.
If you're interested, drop me an email on jon.wood@neos.co.uk and I can answer any questions you might have.

We are in a growing, opportunity-rich enterprise market: $13B are spent every year on professional services for Salesforce development.

We believe in maintaining high-revenue per employee is the best way to ensure that the team is always fun to work for. We admire companies like Basecamp, Mailchimp and Atlassian. We are funded by customer revenue and Indie.vc.

You’ll get to work directly with the CEO and CTO and learn the ins and outs of running a dev tooling startup on the business side.

As we move from serving hundreds of billboards in the US and Canada to serving thousands globally, we need developers. Our current stack is AWS / Postgres (Heroku, Citus) / Redis / Django / Angular. We use Typescript on the front end and a bit of Rust on the back end.
Reach out to me or to allison@blipbillboards.com if you want to learn more.

https://root.engineering/

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

TalkJS | REMOTE (Europe) or ONSITE (Eindhoven, Netherlands) | https://talkjs.com
TalkJS lets developers build custom chat features in hours instead of months. We're product driven and we power communication inside online marketplaces, community sites, trading platforms and so on.
⠀
-- HEAD OF SALES --
Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing to the point that we have more leads than we can manage. This means that now is the time to double down on sales, so we're looking to make our first dedicated sales hire.

We're looking for someone who:


    * Loves tech
    * Has demonstrable experience selling technology B2B
    * Wants to jump on a rocket ship that's just taking off²

We offer you an opportunity to start, build, and lead our sales team as we grow. Significant equity is on the table, as well as the chance to work in a great collaborative, open and constructive distributed team culture.
Read more & apply via https://talkjs.com/jobs/

²) I'm well aware that this is a platitude, but in our case it's really quite true and it wasn't half a year ago. We're blowing up and we need your help :-)
⠀
-- MOBILE DEVELOPER WHO LOVES API DESIGN --
TalkJS is currently focused on the web and that's just not good enough. Easy to use APIs and SDKs are the key to our success on the web, and we're looking to do this natively on mobile as well. We could use your help with that.

If you're an experienced developer who's good at coming up with Java and Swift APIs that Android/iOS devs love to use, then get in touch. We don't have the job opening published yet, so just email to hey@talkjs.com. Bonus points if you can show us an API you designed (on any platform).
Like the sales job, this is remote (Europe) or on-site in Eindhoven, NL.

Zulip | https://zulipchat.com/ | REMOTE or in San Francisco | Senior Mobile Engineer | Full-time | SF
Zulip is the leading 100% free and open source alternative to Slack. Our users love Zulip because of our unique UX with threaded conversations; compared to Slack or its clones, they find discussions in Zulip more productive. See our website for details, or read some Hacker News comment threads filled with Zulip love:* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16863675
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17622987
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18400988
We have a handful of people in the USA, amplified by our enormous and amazing open source contributor community. The entire product is open source; we make money selling hosting on Zulip Cloud as well as commercial support for on-site deployments.

This is an open-source job: all our code is open source and free software. We do our development in the open on GitHub and our own public Zulip instance at chat.zulip.org, and dozens of people contribute code every week from all around the world. You can be anywhere in the world too.

We're primarily looking for an experienced engineer excited about taking our mobile apps to the next level. The ideal candidate has full-stack engineering skills, is experienced at participating in open source communities, has great design sense, gets stuff done, and (if not in SF) has done work remotely before, either professionally or in a major open source project. But ideal candidates may not exist, and we're willing to compromise on some of these things :).

We are also always opportunistically hiring for impressive candidates interested in working on other parts of Zulip (UI/design, infrastructure/scalability, growth, etc.).

Nash | Backend, Mobile, Platform, DevOps | REMOTE | https://nash.io
We are looking for talented people to help us build and secure infrastructure for the cloud-based components of our distributed, non-custodial exchange. If this sounds like your skillset, or even sounds like something you'd like to learn to do, we'd love to hear from you! We are a small team (about 30 people) and our main hiring goal, whatever the position, is to recruit more brilliant, humble people. We work primarily in Elixir and TypeScript for our core services.

A few notable things about the company:

* We employ people from more than 14 different countries. Everyone is remote, including the founders. Pluralities of the team are in the US and Europe.

* We are well capitalized and raised money from both traditional VCs and the public. We launched the first ever public sale of a regulated security token in Europe, NEX (Nash Exchange).

* While we are building a consumer focused non-custodial (often called "decentralized") exchange, we believe strongly in regulatory compliance and have acquired the necessary licenses to operate trading and payment services in the US and Europe.

* Some keywords for people scanning through: elixir, rust, cryptography, distributed system, kubernetes, blockchain, security token, bitcoin, ethereum

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Experience in the following is a plus:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

Language experience: any logic/constraint language (required), C / C++ (plus)

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

You will foster relationships with influential developers and inspire them to use our platform and build innovative, useful things on top of it.

You are a skillful, engaging presenter: unafraid of operating in crowds, and able to confidently project caring, a deep credibility, development expertise and first-hand experience. You will be inspiring developers through educational activities to engage with our platform technologies. You’ll produce and contribute to open-source projects; speak at and attend conferences and industry events, and hackathons; write blog articles; create demos and code samples.

We offer great benefits such as unlimited PTO (paid time off), health/dental/vision insurance, employer-matched 401k, and a bonus plan

Requirements

- Professional experience equivalent to a Lead Engineer or BS in Computer Science (you’ve shipped some code). Very organized; can balance multiple priorities

- Familiar with our product, or able to ramp up to a proficient level in a short time

- Publicly available writing samples and recordings of presentations on tech topics

- Established professional presence on social media and forums

- Some contributions to GitHub and/or open source communities

- Ability and willing to spend 50% of your time traveling: domestically between Tardigrade headquarters in Salt Lake City and San Francisco and Atlanta, with a permanent residence in one of these cities; and internationally (Europe and Asia)

Aquabyte (https://www.aquabyte.ai, backed by NEA and Costanoa, top tier investors) is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.

Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.

Adacado | Intermediate and Senior Software Engineers, FE and BE | Vancouver, BC, Canada | Full-time, onsite
You have over 3-5 years of coding and web application expertise, and want to do more innovative development and less mundane operations support.

“Creating Change is what we do.”

Adacado is looking for expert FE and BE programmers (ES6/CSS or Golang) to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically. You’re the type of developer that is never satisfied. You strive to create new technologies/design patterns, and/or completely abandoning current systems and undertaking complete re-builds, using all the latest technology. You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.

“Fail often, fail fast.”

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges. Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, Node and ES6, and utilizes Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch. We manage an ever growing army of microserviceswith special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise. You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis. You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’. You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill. You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues. We value expert specialists over expert generalists.

The Adacado Team

Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit. We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.

We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget. All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit. Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks. We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.

How to Apply

Please send your CV and cover letter to careers@adacado.com, and indicate you are applying from Hacker News.

Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.

- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.

- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.

- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.

We are hiring for the backend and frontend roles and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.
