Finally we are strong enough to write one of these who is hiring ads. Yes, we're hiring!
Who we are: The Modular Company, tech DD services for Venture Capital and Private Equity customers.

We're growing rapidly, we doubled year-on-year for the last three years, looking to do this again this year. Right now we have a mix of part and full-timers that form two teams and we are looking to build a third team in the next three months.

We are looking for an all-round tech person to help out with the Due Diligence work we do, preparation, interviews and report writing. Competitive salary, stock and bonus. If you are curious, want to know what makes things work and would like to join a team that consists of interesting people then please respond, we're color blind, age agnostic (our team spans 3 decades) and would be happy to hire women, men and in fact anybody else as long as they positively contribute to team and atmosphere.

Warning: this work is not for everybody. It is super intense, we deliver a 20-30 page report each week, it is fun and addictive but if you are unable to pace yourself then likely you are better off in a more regulated environment, we are not going to 'hold your hand' but give you all the freedom you need to succeed or mess up. English writing and speaking skills are almost as important as your tech background. We are 'radically transparent', that means that once every month we send out a very detailed report on how the business is doing to ensure that everybody is on the same page. This includes financials, a retrospective of the past month, looking forward to the month ahead and anything else that might be of interest.
Location: Near Amsterdam, Netherlands (Hilversum)
Remote is ok, but some office presence required, we work all over Europe. Some of us work from abroad (Poland) but this is while workable, not ideal so if you're in or near Amsterdam or Hilversum that would be better.
You may contact me through jacques@modularcompany.com if you're interested.
No recruiters or agencies please.

The Content Engineering team is in need of both software engineers and senior software engineers, onsite in our new San Francisco office, onsite in our Toronto office, or remote within the United States.

The work includes building data pipelines, data engineering, and a touch of machine learning.

Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture with competitive salary and great benefits. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance. In general we care way more about your personality and hacking skills than what languages you’ve used so far.

Command E | Senior Software Engineer (engineer #2) | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE (North America only)
Hi HN! I'm the Founder & CTO of Command E…a lightning-fast, secure way to instantly find anything in the cloud with a simple keyboard shortcut. We're building a desktop app (Electron/React/Redux/SQLite) that syncs cloud data locally to your laptop and provides a Spotlight-like search & command interface on top of your cloud data.

Command E is basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data. It's inspired by the "fuzzy finder" search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, ⌘T in Atom, ⌘P in VSCode, etc.). The app has a lot of polish and a very clean, simple design. We already support many enterprise and consumer cloud services (Salesforce, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Asana, Trello, 15+ more).

We're a small team of 3 Silicon Valley veterans, well-capitalized by top Silicon Valley VC firms + angel investors. Both co-founders are engineers who worked at a VC firm, Eventbrite, and Digg. Our office is at 2nd and Market in San Francisco.
We're looking to hire 2 senior/core engineers. You'll be building a top-notch Silicon Valley company with experienced founders going after a massive market: search. Electron experience (or desire) is a big plus, but we're open to other backgrounds too. My co-founder and I met ~5 years ago through a "Who's Hiring" thread so we're excited to see who responds to this one - please email me at ben@getcommande.com if you’re interested.

Repod | Mobile Engineer | Full-Time | Remote | San Diego
At Repod, our goal is to empower people to discover, listen, and share great podcasts. Podcasts are unique in that they inspire us, help us learn something new, or captivate us with the way stories are told. Yet, all of these experiences are rarely shared with one another. By connecting people with an easy way to share and discuss podcasts, Repod helps people find and listen to great podcasts.

Currently, we are a two person team (2 cofounders) and are looking for our 1st full-time team member by way of mobile engineer. We are in the midst of a public beta and will be launching in the near future.

As the lead mobile engineer at Repod, you'll initially be working in our main repo developing and launching new features. Repod is built using React Native and relies heavily on a native audio player built in Swift/Java. As we expand our product, you’ll help inform the technologies used in our future growth. The team is small, which means your impact on the company’s success will be instrumental.

We have one requirement — must love podcasts.

Interested? Find our post at  https://angel.co/company/repod/jobs/553851-mobile-engineer or send us a note to hello@repod.io

Kalepa | Machine Learning Engineers, Backend / Data Engineers, Full-Stack Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISAKalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.
One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Stacker | Europe + Africa Timezones | REMOTE ONLY
Stacker lets people build apps without code on a modular app platform. We want to change the way software is built and make it available to everyone.

That's a pretty big task, and we've got some pretty exciting problems:

If you're a FRONTEND ENGINEER, come and talk to us about how we're building an app runtime that lets you specify an entire app in a bunch of JSON config and have it run as a real-time single page app.

If you're a PRODUCT MANAGER, get in touch and we can chat about how we're taking the features common across all web apps and turning them into installable modules that work seamlessly together.

If you're a PRODUCT DESIGNER, tell us how you'd go about creating not just one design system, but a design-system system to allow our users to build apps that are beautiful by default, but be customisable to the finest level.

If you like PINA COLADA and getting CAUGHT IN THE RAIN, then get in touch anyway.

We're a fully remote team, Europe+Africa timezones only please. We believe in radical transparency, being good people and making a dent in the universe.
Apply at https://stacker.app/jobs or email jobs@stacker.app. Again, Europe+Africa timezones only PLEASE.  :)

--Who we are-- 
We’re a tech based real estate company in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We specifically chose this market because we were driven by the problems we once faced as tenants, owners and property agents. Our vision is to simplify the property acquisition minus the red tapes through taking control over the Agents and backend processes. 
We’re convinced that we are able to solve the issues with duplicated listings, fake agents, and unqualified tenants/buyers. 
We are learning, and trying constantly to add value for our users and the agents wherever we can through different touchpoints, enabling them to make the right choice while maintaining the best user experience.--JD--
We're looking for Full Stack Developers who are familiar with 
Ruby on Rails, HTML and Javascript.
If you've had experience with AWS, it will be a good bonus.
We currently only accept applicants who are either currently residing in Malaysia or who are Malaysian citizens. The option for remote work was there, but as a startup we don't have the luxury to resources and time to closely monitor tech. We prefer that you'd be phisically present for the job.
--Our Culture-- 
We are a small family of dreamers, driven by the same vision: to bring on positive changes to the property industry. 
As a team, our strength lies into our diversity of backgrounds, interests and cultures. We work in an open office environment, which fosters interactions and fast paced decisions. 
We favor ability and a can-do mindset over experience and degrees. 
So, if you are ... 
tired of corporate jobs and want to go maverick 
a go-getter and usually says “I’ll do it !” 
in a habit of learning new things 
Drop everything and apply now because we’re expanding our family!Send your resumes / CVs to founders@bumbung.co, we will send you an email with a quick test to see how you fare out. Cheers!

Tierra (tierra.co) | Software Engineer | San Fransisco, CA/Mexico City | Remote | Full-time
Come make the world a safer place. Literally.

Imagine having all your day-to-day decisions dictated by a simple question – “Am I putting myself in danger? ” And then not having any real way to answer that question. Countries like Mexico are experiencing an unprecedented wave of crime and violence. The cost is real:

• 530 billion USD get spent in LATAM on safety and security; 9.4% of Mexico’s GDP

• ~6% of gross revenues for companies is spent on safety/crime prevention

• 8 people go missing per day in Mexico

• 40% of people have changed their habits due to safety concerns

At Tierra, we are working to empower those who are most at risk with the data to make their day-to-day lives safer. We are a team of previously successful entrepreneurs (Twitter, Google, Stripe) based in San Francisco working closely with both governments and corporates in Mexico to pool data and make it actionable.

We work with very large data sets that drive us to constantly improve our technical skills (ever tried to render 1 million data points on a Google map and suggest safe routes?)

We strongly believe (and have begun to prove) that it’s possible to make a real difference by applying technology to a problem that affects hundreds of millions of people on a daily basis. All of us feel a sense of urgency and passion to make the world a little safer.

Want to come join and make a difference? Get in touch: jobs@tierra.co
Full stack engineering position. Node.js, Python, and React stack.
Remote only – some of us spend time together in SF/Mexico City on a flexible basis.
Market compensation (both equity and cash). We are well funded.
Female led. Truly diverse and inclusive team.

InCountry is creating a new cloud infrastructure category - “data residency as a service”. As the internet’s regulatory landscape fractures around the globe, SaaS providers are increasing subject to strict controls regulating how and where certain information is stored. InCountry - founded by six-time founder Peter Yared -  is building a global, targeted storage and compute network which allows customers to transparently meet data regulations as they are changing around the world.
We are seeking senior engineers to join our team to work on a wide range of distributed systems and cloud infrastructure problems. We have technical challenges on a deep stack including: highly available systems and storage, cluster management, global networking, container orchestration, secure systems and key management, performance scaling and API design. Currently our stack is focused around Python and Postgres, but we will introduce Golang and Mongo DB to the stack this year.

Some key qualifications:
- Extensive experience with cloud infrastructure, either as a user or builder
- Experience up and down the stack
- You have carried the pager and operated web systems at scale
This is a chance to help build critical global infrastructure from the ground up. We are looking for people willing to code and mentor, but who can also write a great design spec. We are growing fast and working in a rapidly changing global landscape, so you should enjoy working fast in the face of ambiguity. The trade-off is autonomy, fast decisions, and big impact. Work wherever you want - InCountry is already a globally distributed team.
Headquarters is in SF, but we are globally distributed and encourage remote applicants.
Apply jobs at incountry.com or https://www.indeed.com/job/hands-architect-cloud-infrastructure-remote-ok-014a7ac5aae61f12

Hack Club | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE | https://hackclub.com
Launched 3 years ago, Hack Club is a global network of student-led hacker clubs now spanning 315 high schools, 35 states, and 17 countries with an estimated 10,000 students impacted by our programs each year.

We’re looking to bring in a product-minded full stack engineer to own development and growth of Hack Club Bank (https://hackclub.com/bank/), which we launched on Hacker News four months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241).

Hack Club Bank is growing quickly, crossing $600K in transactions two weeks ago. You will have a founder-like engineering role and will work with our founder and Executive Director to flesh out the vision and strategy. You will lead the charge to get us to $6M in transactions over the next 12 months. The potential goes way beyond high school hackathons: it’s every US nonprofit with an annual budget of under ~$300K (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship).

The product is revenue generating, we’re a well-funded growing nonprofit that recently won the $1M Frank Foundation grant (https://grant.frank.ly/), and we have two major partnerships for HC Bank close to closing, but we need the right person to make them happen. These two partnerships would add an additional $4M in transactions over the next 12 months alone.
Interested? Email me at zach@hackclub.com with why you think you’d be a good fit for this role. About you: obsessive, product-minded, deeply technical, past experience with Rails and if not, able to learn.

Root Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite / remote (US only)| $80k-$170k
https://root.engineering/
Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Abine Inc. | Privacy | Remote | Boston, MA
Abine Inc. provides online privacy software and services to consumers. We have hundreds of thousands of active daily users, and are looking to grow our team. If you care about privacy and security for the masses then come talk to us.
We are specifically looking for part and full time roles:

* DevOps & Sysadmin Engineers (especially with AWS experience). Ideally you'd have years of experience with Linux systems, done a great job implementing devlops workflows, but also care about the care and feeding and protection of all the infrastructure you touch.

Devops: https://abine.breezy.hr/p/9fcce0a83b58-devops-engineer-sysadmin

We are also looking for capable linux admins with less devops experience (but are capable) but who are skilled as systems and network security -- especially in cloud environments.

* Full stack engineer (from angular to RoR to bash to java and back again) to work with us on improving our privacy products across multiple platforms and languages.  To us "full-stack" means you can work on a system from end-to-end, and can apply CS knowledge and experience across specific languages and platforms appropriately.  Flexibility and quick learning is a must. Most of our code is client software so it helps if you've had to deal with client specific issues (e.g. dealing with long-tail distribution of client versions etc.)

Full-Stack: https://abine.breezy.hr/p/d5c9249c8227-contract-full-stack-engineer-remote

We are still a small team, so your work will have an immediate and real impact. You also won't be stuck with a routine - we touch many types of systems and problems, so raw capability is more important than direct experience. What can you do over what have you done is what matters most.

ZipCam https://www.zip.cam | Full-time | Part-time | Onsite | Remote | Palo Alto, CA
ZipCam is making intelligent, connected dashcams for driving safety. In the U.S., more than 37,000 lives per year are lost in automobile accidents. Worldwide, an unbelievable 1.25 million people die from car crashes annually. We don't need full self-driving technology to save these lives: we can add computer vision and machine learning technology to existing cars to help people drive more safely, today, in the car they already own.

ZipCam is looking for machine learning engineers with experience in classification and object recognition in (driving) video clips. Multiple positions available.

* Summer internship. Onsite (Palo Alto) or Remote OK. Neural network analysis of driving video clips: lane-keeping, accident "near miss" detection, sign reading, stop light classification, stop line detection, other driving tasks. Also with a driver-facing camera: classification of various kinds of distraction (cell phone use, etc). Grad student or college junior/senior with with excellent course background in machine learning and computer science. Possibility to co-author an academic paper. Possible long term employment. $5k/month for a very experienced candidate.

* Midlevel or Senior Machine Learning Engineer. Full-time. Onsite (Palo Alto) or Remote OK. Major equity & good salary for the right candidate; let's talk. We are seed stage and well funded by angels. You should be have experience running accelerated ML models on video data in the cloud; otherwise we are still stack-agnostic at this point. Experience with internet-of-things (connected cameras) is a plus. Low-power (embedded) computer vision experience is a plus. Management experience is a plus; we will be hiring. Drop us a line to learn more about the product roadmap, it's exciting. This is a big moment in history for this kind of real-world machine learning.
Please send your resume + linkedin & github URLs to jobs@zip.cam. In your email please include any relevant publications. Describe some large datasets you have worked with. Looking forward to speaking with you.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, a year ago I moved Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. More here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

The work will include: Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK.
Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud and include a direct link to an open source contribution you've made, or an issue you've logged, no matter how small. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Experience in the following is a plus:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

Language experience: any logic/constraint language (required), C / C++ (plus)

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Quill.org | Software Engineer | New York, NY | ONSITE, SALARY: 70k-120k
React / Ruby / Rails / Python / Machine Learning

At Quill.org, we’ve created an online learning platform to help middle school students, primarily lower income ones, improve their reading and writing ability. Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.

Some info about Quill.org:
- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers
- We served over 1 million students last year and are continuing to grow.
- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts.
- We’ve been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to name a few.
As a member of our engineering team, you will be directly involved in building tools for students, teachers, and administrators. We are looking for developers who can take features from a user story to production. We are a rapidly-growing team of 13 working in the Financial District of New York City. This is a full-time role on-site, and we cannot sponsor a visa at this time.

TalkJS | REMOTE (Europe only) or ONSITE (Eindhoven, Netherlands) | https://talkjs.com
TalkJS lets developers build custom chat features in hours instead of months. We're product driven and we power communication inside online marketplaces, community sites, trading platforms and so on.

-- ONLINE MARKETER --

Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing to the point that we have no time left to work on the funnel that drives this demand. This is a luxury problem, which we intend to solve with full force with the help of you, an experienced online marketer with a passion for technical products. We're looking for someone who:


    * Has demonstrable experience growing B2B SaaS inbound
    * Has sufficient tech skills to set up analytics pipelines 
    * Proactively iterates and experiments
    * Can write
    * Wants to jump on a rocket ship that's just taking off²

Bonus points if you can code a bit. We offer you an opportunity to start, build, and lead our marketing team as we grow. Significant equity is on the table, as well as the chance to work in a great collaborative, open, and constructive distributed team culture.
Apply by sending an email to hey@talkjs.com. Mention something you've helped grow and include something you've written. This can be anything that shows your ability to enthuse: a blog post or a landing page or even a flyer for the local christmas fair.

²) I'm well aware that this is a platitude, but in our case it's really quite true and it wasn't half a year ago. We're blowing up and we need your help :-)

-- MOBILE DEVELOPER WHO LOVES API DESIGN --

TalkJS is currently focused on the web and that's just not good enough. Easy to use APIs and SDKs are the key to our success on the web, and we're looking to do this natively on mobile as well. We could use your help with that.

If you're an experienced developer who's good at coming up with Java and Swift APIs that Android/iOS devs love to use, then get in touch. We don't have the job opening published yet, so just email to hey@talkjs.com. Bonus points if you can show us an API you designed (on any platform).

Like the marketing job, this is remote (Europe) or on-site in Eindhoven, NL. ⠀
No recruiters or agencies, please.

Lightning Labs | Frontend Developer, Crypto Protocol Engineer, Dev Ops, Infrastructure | San Francisco | Onsite or Remote | Full-time
https://angel.co/lightning/ https://lightning.engineering/

Lightning Labs is hiring! We’re looking to expand our team to build technology that scales Bitcoin and blockchains. Our current focus is the development and deployment of the Lightning Network, an open blockchain scalability protocol. We push the edge of innovation with regard to blockchain scalability, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX. If you’re interested in one of the positions below, please send a brief description of your relevant experience and resume/github to jobs@lightning.engineering. And if you know someone who might be a good fit, we'd very much appreciate any referrals.

{Crypto Protocol Engineer}:

Experienced systems software engineer versed in applied cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems, open source software, and cryptocurrency protocols to design and implement core protocol and algorithmic components of the Lightning Network. Solid programming skills, experience with Go, C, or C++. Prior contributions to crypto protocols and open source software collaboration preferred.

{Frontend Application Developer}:

Frontend developer to build secure cross-platform second-layer blockchain applications. Our applications are built on React, React Native, MobX, and Electron, communicating with a Lightning daemon over a binary RPC protocol. Ideal applicants will have experience building and shipping React Native applications and maintaining open source projects.

{Infrastructure and Distributed Systems Engineer}:

Systems-oriented engineer to build highly-available, secure systems, lowering the barrier to entry for operating routing nodes and making Lightning more useable in general. Tasks include writing advanced software tooling for automated channel management, initial client channel selection (autopilot), ongoing capital management and optimization, monitoring infrastructure for routing nodes, and creating novel systems for obtaining and managing channel liquidity within the network.

{DevOps Engineer}:
We currently deploy a number of backend services that make Lightning easier to use built on technology such as: etcd, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, and Traefik. Your role would be to help us secure and scale these systems via intelligent automation and robust service architecture. Experience with AWS is a bonus, as well as experience with Bitcoin, particularly in the area of key management.

Paystack (YC W16) | Software/Cloud Engineers, Hiring/Training/Agile Leads | Nigeria | Full-time | Remote | https://paystack.com/engineering
Paystack helps businesses in Africa get paid by anyone, anywhere in the world. We raised a Series A from Stripe and Visa and are a growing team of 77 friends (21 engineers) with a mission to accelerate digital commerce in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

We're expanding across Africa and have people from as far as Canada, France, and Turkey. We help relocate anyone interested to where our offices are, but we're also determined about remote. Due to rapid growth, half of us are remote today.

One specific occasion we do require our people to be present at is our quarterly off-site. Four times a year, we fly you in for an extended weekend of jam-packed fun and company-wide check-in, and should you opt for extending your stay a little bit, we host you at our guest house or a sweet hotel. Here’re a few photos from our Q3 offsite (https://bit.ly/2GkPcZx)

We enjoy a close relationship with some of the most interesting technology companies in the world. GitHub CEO Nat Friedman recently swung by our Lagos office (https://bit.ly/2xLmGLy) and we also hosted teams from Stripe (https://bit.ly/2XGxK7m)

Our engineering has independent infrastructure, frontend, and (multiple) backend teams that work closely with product, growth, and business. We deploy JavaScript on AWS, data on MySQL, maintain some legacy PHP alongside small Java services.

We're making great efforts to modularize and improve the quality of our codebases on a quest to embrace asynchronous processing and independent microservices on cloud-agnostic infrastructure.

We're very proud of our product, and we made a promise to ourselves to make our codebase a thing of envy.

So here's what we need; people better than us in every way.

We're a tight bunch of curious people hungry for experienced colleagues to take us to the next level. We crave highly skilled, kind teammates who hold themselves to high standards, and care as fiercely as we do about pursuing collective growth and learning.

A challenge to build a payments growth engine for an entire continent does not come often. It's an especially interesting time to join Paystack.

Our hiring is not very conventional and we try to personalize it. We mainly rely on working together on a sample, fictitious project. We'll recognize experience, insatiable curiosity, and an immense passion for sharing.
My name is Serkan. I myself have joined Paystack only 8 months ago when we were less than 35 people and have been leading engineering for the past 3 months from my home in Turkey. Please don't hesitate to reach me at serkan@paystack.com and let's begin chatting.

Getaway | Brooklyn, NY (or close by, able to drop in twice a month) | Back End Developer, Rails | Full-Time | Onsite (or nearby) | https://getaway.house
If you’re reading this job description, you’re probably someone that spends a lot of time on the computer and the internet. Although we at Getaway leverage these tools like any other business does, our product seeks to physically take our customers away from these things in an effort to find the magic and relaxation they’ve so desperately been seeking. We’re putting tiny houses on camp sites in remote locations so our “users” can get away and set up a high-speed interface with their humanity. We create and maintain technology that, in some cases invisibly, enables a mystical experience for our guests and removes stress from their lives!

Getaway is a small but rapidly growing team that just raised a $22.5M Series B financing round. Our offices our located in Downtown Brooklyn but we are open to semi-remote candidates that can visit our offices at least twice a month.
The Back End Developer will focus on the following areas:
- Building new features for and maintaining the current functionality of our website, written  with a Ruby on Rails back end and a React/SASS front end, in a semi-agile working environment
- Brainstorming and iterating on existing features, with some projects in the next few months including a new accounts portal for our guests, a new financial data analysis software to be built, and ensuring our site can handle more traffic as we scale
- Some minor developer operations tasks ensuring the website is serving our customers well and performing to our expectations - we’re hosted currently on Heroku
- Supporting the cabin automation effort, working on software to make the guest experience seamless and magical, including work on our house door lock automation software and leak sensors, for instance. This is mostly written in Ruby and Groovy, soon moving to all Python and Ruby
- Writing internal tools to support our Guest Experience team and make it extremely easy for guests to get the things they need to have a wonderful time on their Getaways
- Continuing to find efficiencies and ways to leverage software to improve our team’s workflows and the way we do business
- Occasionally writing code in front of a fire, if you so desire (for real!)
We’re looking for someone with around 2 years of experience but don’t want anyone to shy away from applying if they think they’re a real “rockstar/ninja/etc”. This is not a junior development role and those straight out of school or bootcamp need not apply, unfortunately we just don’t have the resources to support such a candidate at this time.
Interested developers should send a short cover letter and resume to jobs@getaway.house, subject line, “Back End Developer Role”.
