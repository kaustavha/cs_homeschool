Levels | Frontend, Mobile, Backend developer; Data Science / ML | Remote, San Francisco, New York | Full-time
Levels is a funded, early stage startup working on making a dent in the metabolic crisis. Poor metabolic health is a risk factor for many diseases, and few people have the right tools to create positive feedback cycles with their diet and exercise. Based on our early Beta pilot, we're seeing people meaningfully change health habits, and are looking for people to help build our product out.

We're currently hiring for two roles:

* Full stack engineer. Our stack is currently React / Node / TypeScript + JavaScript / React Native. You'll help us build our direct-to-consumer buy flow, mobile app that processes biometric data from a sensor, and data display site.

* Data scientist / ML engineer. We have a lot of biometric data, and want to help people make sense of it with clear recommendations, anomaly detection, etc.

We're a remote-first team (with people in New York, SF Bay Area, Pennsylvania, and Portland currently), and—while we're excited to build our product—value a good quality of life and balance. Previously, folks in our team led startups, worked at SpaceX/Google, and had medical practices.
If any of this is interesting, even if your background doesn't line up exactly with the roles above, please reach out. I'm happy to share more information about what we're doing and we'll see if there's a good fit. Email me (Andrew) at jobs@levelshealth.com and mention HN.

Survata | Sr. Front-End Engineer, Sr. Data/Infrastructure Engineer, Sr. Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco | Full-time, On-site (Remote for the right candidate)
About Survata

Survata is a YC/venture-funded startup building the Brand Intelligence Platform. We offer a comprehensive set of tools that help our Fortune 100 clients understand and improve how they’re perceived in the marketplace, how aware consumers are of the value they provide, and how much consumers trust them to provide the value they promise.

About the Role

Survata has already built an excellent backend system for gathering and statistically analyzing data on consumer sentiment. But our revenue and client list are growing fast, which means we've got to adapt to new levels of scale in our data pipelines. We also are building out a suite of interactive, visually compelling, self-serve analytical tools to help marketers ask and answer sophisticated strategic questions (and visually communicate their results to internal stakeholders).

We need experienced technical leaders to work on our data pipelines, our Web API, and our React/Redux-based data visualization dashboard.

Quill.org | Software Engineer | New York, NY | ONSITE
React / Ruby / Rails / Python / Machine Learning
At Quill.org, we’ve created an online learning platform to help middle school students, primarily lower income ones, improve their reading and writing ability. Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.

Some info about Quill.org:

- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-p...

- We served over 1 million students last year and are continuing to grow.

- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts.

- We’ve been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (to name a few).

As a member of our engineering team, you will be directly involved in building tools for students, teachers, and administrators. We are looking for developers who can take features from a user story to production. We are a rapidly-growing team of 15 working in the Financial District of New York City. This is a full-time role on-site, and we cannot sponsor a visa at this time.
We're hiring: Junior, Mid-level, and Senior Full-Stack Engineers. Full positions here: https://www.quill.org/careers

Reporting directly to the CTO, success in the role requires a pragmatic approach. You will be encouraged to stay up to date with the latest tools, trends and techniques and will be tasked with recognizing when shiny, new things are right for the business - and when they’re not. We currently use Java, Scala, React, Akka, Apache Spark, Java EE, WildFly, Play Framework, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, AWS, Git and Docker. We’re experimenting with and eager to implement Kotlin. We also use JIRA, Confluence, CircleCI and Github. We offer:

  - $2500/year for professional development
  - An experienced, tight-knit engineering team

Localize is a platform used by 500+ companies to translate websites and applications into other languages. We're used by companies like Trello to translate their help center (https://help.trello.com/), Tinder to translate their blog (https://blog.gotinder.com/), and RocketMiles to translate their web app (https://www.rocketmiles.com/) - to see our product in action, click any of those links and use the website's language switcher to switch from English to another language.

Localize automatically deploys those translations to the customer's production site.

We're hiring a Product Designer to own & shape the customer experience. You'll oversee new functionality from early concept, to wireframe, to prototype/mockup, to pixel-perfect design and launch. Please get in touch if you're a seasoned product designer with extensive experience designing UI / UX for B2B SaaS products (design portfolio a must). To apply, please see our job posting below or email myself, brandon@localizejs.com, and say hello!

Aquabyte | San Francisco, CA | Full Time | ONSITE, VISA
Aquabyte (https://www.aquabyte.ai.), backed by NEA and Costanoa, top tier investors, is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.
