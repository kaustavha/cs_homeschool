Latacora | Security Engineers | Full-time | Chicago or Remote
You could pick one startup to work for. But why choose? You can also work for a bunch of them simultaneously. That's what we did. We're Latacora, and we're building a security team that runs security teams for startups. We're a weird firm: we have only one kind of client, and we work full-time with them for 6-18 months, doing everything a security team does, from software security to cryptography design to AWS and container lockdown.

We've been working together since 2005 (when we were called Matasano). And for almost as long, we've been hiring people off the HN hiring thread. We don't care about resumes or previous work experience. Rather, we're interested in aptitude and level of interest in the problems we're working on. No phone screens, no whiteboard interviews. More than you could want to know about our hiring process: https://latacora.com/careers

We're hiring 3 roles:

* Secops people, who do cloud and network security and security automation.

* Appsec people, who do software security assessments, watch PRs, and do app design meetings.

* Corpsec people, who protect endpoints and IT assets and put vendors through the security wringer.

Everyone at Latacora delivers work, from the partners on down, and everyone writes software --- so one skill you'll want to have going in is "able to solve problems by writing software".

jobs@latacora.com
Full-time only. Remote fine, but must be in the US.

Evidation Health | Santa Barbara, SF, San Mateo | Full time and Interns | ONSITE or REMOTE | https://evidation.com/careers/
Evidation runs health studies combining digital data with traditional markers.  In addition we run a "why don't you build some good habits" consumer app.

It's an exciting place to be: we work with companies you've heard of to do research you'll hear of. Additionally the company really does only pursue business opportunities that it thinks lead to better health outcomes, so I don't have to worry (much) about all our data being used for advertising or worse.  There's a strong culture around privacy, security, and only using data as consented.

As listed on the careers page we have openings on all teams and for all offices, but I'm specifically leading a small team of Rails backend engineers in Santa Barbara who work on "bridge" services that talk to 3rd party APIs, primarily for data ingestion. I'd love to talk to someone with 2+ years of backend experience in or interested in relocating to Santa Barbara. The company in general is very remote friendly and I'd consider adding remote to this team for the right candidate, but more likely at this time a remote Rails engineer would fit in best on one of our other Rails backend teams.
I'm happy to field and route general inquiries about other roles and teams, but again especially looking for a Rails engineer who'd enjoy working on critical data ingestion and related services.    jkimmel  at evidation dot com

React / Ruby / Rails / Python / Machine Learning

At Quill.org, we’ve created an online learning platform to help middle school students, primarily lower income ones, improve their reading and writing ability. Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.

Some info about Quill.org:

- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers

- We served over 1 million students last year and are continuing to grow.

- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts.

- We’ve been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to name a few.

As a member of our engineering team, you will be directly involved in building tools for students, teachers, and administrators. We are looking for developers who can take features from a user story to production. We are a rapidly-growing team of 15 working in the Financial District of New York City.

Like our sister company, InstaLOD, we’re enabling enterprise and entertainment companies to create magical 3D experiences in a faster, automated, and scalable way. From military companies building next-generation simulations and data analysis to leading automotive and game developers — our tech plays a vital part in delivering their project.

Please provide an up-to-date resume including sample code of previous work that you can share to Michael@theabstract.co.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | UTC+4 to UTC+8 | REMOTE | $42k-$60k
SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses

More than half of our developers are now remote, and I'd like to continue the trend.

To find out more about us, check our developer blog (https://tech.simplepay.cloud) or about page (https://www.simplepay.co.za/about)

Stack: Our work is back-end-heavy Ruby on Rails and we use PostgreSQL as our data store. We use a bit of Vue.js but believe server-side rendering is still the best default.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby.

Location: UTC+4 to UTC+8 preferred, although we'll also consider candidates in UTC+1 to UTC+3 if they have the right skills and experience.
Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud and include a direct link to an open source contribution you've made, or an issue you've logged, no matter how small.

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Lead | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.

Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Come and discover the Lovely Portugal, our weather is great, excellent travel locations, rent is still accessible (as long as you stay out of the city center - there are good transports), welcoming people (you'll get along fine knowing just English), liberal views.

Unnamed Seed Stage Startup | Founding Engineer OR Founding Design/Product Role | Remote and Bay Area | Full Time
We are a new startup in the UX design tool space, with a mission to radically lower the barriers needed to build full-fidelity prototypes and products—something currently accessible only to a tiny and privileged sub-population (developers).  The stage is very early, pre-product, but we have enthusiastic early feedback.

The team of four has three ex-founders.  We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.

We received strong (outlier) funding offers from a number of top tier VCs.  We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of amazing angels/funds, including leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer.  No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.
If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com.  Thanks, we're excited to hear from you!

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.
Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.

Prometheus Research | DevOps Team Lead | New Haven, CT | Full Time | REMOTE | https://prometheusresearch.com/
We are searching for a development operations team leader to continue our transition to the cloud. This is a remote position with eastern timezone working hours, but we need a US Citizen or permanent resident.

Prometheus Research builds and maintains clinical patient registries for health care associations and medical research institutions. Over the past year, we've been updating our solution delivery systems to use Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform and GCP. Our application platform is containerized and uses PostgreSQL, Python, Nginx, and other tools.  Working knowledge about OWASP, OAuth, Linux, VPNs, Firewalls, Logging, Monitoring, and other traditional system administration technologies and skills are essential to this role. We are also in a heavily regulated industry; specific domain knowledge includes: HIPAA, HITECH, FedOnRamp, and others.

This team lead position is a full-time, fully remote position (little travel) with fully remote team members. Thus, it's important to have excellent written communication and know how to use Markdown, diagramming tools, give presentations, and make training videos. We expect about 1d/week of administrative duties, including managing (via O3s) a team of 2-3 system administrators and developers. Your peers will be leading engineering and solution development teams.

Prometheus doesn't have a single SaaS, instead, it has custom solutions for each of our clients. Hence, this position has a different flavor from other roles. We are seeking to transition from a centralized release team to one where each customer solution development team is responsible for their own releases. Our ideal candidate will see themselves as a tool builder, educator, and engineer that is building repeatable processes that client services teams could use.

If this sounds like something you're interested in, please drop me an email, devops-20190903-group@prometheusresearch.com, thanks!
P.S. We are also looking for a senior software engineer. For this, you could see the posting at https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Prometheus-Research/

What's Parse.ly? A real-time content measurement layer for the entire web.

Parse.ly is trusted by over 400 enterprises, used by over 4,000 high-traffic websites, and has tens of thousands of active user seats for its core analytics product.

We are an established, but quickly-growing, company with a 20+ person product team and millions of dollars in revenue.

Our beautiful dashboards visualize data flowing from over 1 billion monthly unique devices. You can see a recent example of a fun data visualization product we made from this data at https://currents.parsely.com. (Make sure you are not using an ad-blocker when checking it out.)

The mission of our lean & fully distributed team is described here:

https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission/?utm_campaign=hn_sep_2019

We happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. Here's a photograph of mine running two full-screen Parse.ly dashboards on my monitors:

https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73

As a frontend engineer, you'll join the small sub-team that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s customer-facing SaaS dashboard. You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to customers -- working in JavaScript/ES, HTML5, CSS3, Python3, and some other great technologies.

For this role, you’ll need to be strong in JavaScript; have a keen sense of good design; have experience with web/mobile frameworks; and enjoy D3.js.

For bonus points, you'd develop some comfort level implementing native iOS or Android applications.

In short, we're looking for people who enjoy crafting beautiful user experiences & products, and who also enjoy shipping to customers regularly.

You need to be technical enough to do real Python/Django programming for our middle tier HTTP/JSON service; to do real D3.js visualizations by hand in JavaScript; to navigate JS frameworks like AngularJS & ReactJS, including 10,000+ LOC codebases; to evaluate open source projects pragmatically; and to develop some experience with native mobile development.

Join us to build the world's best content analytics dashboard. Apply at work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/code you think is relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile.
Make sure to mention HN and the "Frontend Engineer" role. Also, please list your years of frontend engineering experience, current timezone/location, and daily working hours (e.g. 10am-6pm ET). Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US_Eastern, US_Central, and US_Mountain timezones, due to our current team working hours.

ANN ARBOR, MI and COLUMBUS, OH | ONSITE
# JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, .NET, QA AUTOMATION, UX DESIGN, IOS/ANDROID/MOBILE DEVS and more!

https://www.nexient.com/careers/apply

----- My description -----

(I'm a Sysadmin / DevOps person, I'm not HR or recruitment, but my posting here has been approved by the recruiting dept. I wouldn't post this if I thought this wasn't an actually great company to work for!)

Nexient are good people: My experience at Nexient has been overwhelmingly positive, they are flexible, caring and fun to work at. They actually care about the life/work balance too. Multiple tabletop, D&D, console gaming nights are organized all the time. Charity drives and other ways to give are also promoted within the company. The work environment is really nice too, with motorized standing/sitting desks and laptops that actually have enough memory!! Nexient do outsourcing but with US-based staff, we work closely with clients so we're just part of the team.

Nexient are also working hard to add hundreds of tech jobs in Michigan and Ohio. There's a real need for good folks to help us help our clients.

----- Recruiting Dept's Description -----

Nexient is hiring! In 2009, we launched Nexient to give American businesses a more responsive, domestic alternative to sending software development offshore. We knew we could deliver better software faster by collaborating with clients in real time. Today, we’re the only 100% US tech company among the World’s Top 100 Outsourcers. Every day, we help dozens of businesses — mostly Fortune 500 companies and fast-growing tech product companies — accelerate their products and services to market and increase their agility.

We are hiring software programmers across all levels – for backend and frontend development using Java, C++, JavaScript, Angular, React and associated technology stacks. The list of current openings is available at https://www.nexient.com/careers. These are full time positions working from Nexient’s delivery center at Ann Arbor, MI. Visa sponsorship and telecommute / remote work options are not available for these roles.

----- TO APPLY -----

To apply, please use either my email address, aclark@nexient.com OR https://www.nexient.com/careers and mention my email address and name, Anthony Clark.
I could potentially get a bonus if you are hired, just want to fully disclose that I could personally benefit from your actions.

Beacon Biosignals | Lead Front-End Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
About us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.

About you:

- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.

- You believe that honesty and frequent, open communication are more signficant contributors to software development than technical wizardy.

- You believe that "looks great" does not necessarily equal "feels great", and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).

- You want to build tools that help people help others in critical environments.

- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between "DRY" as an important guiding principle of software development, and "DRY" as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.

- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.

- You nerd out about content-specific adaptive streaming and compression techniques.

- You think Observable notebooks are really cool.

- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.

- From a front-end perspective, you recognize the tension in the development feedback loop between client-side software and a back-end service ecosystem, and derive immense satisfaction from improving development processes to relieve those tensions.

- You're intimately familiar with the lifecycle of software components - from experiment, to prototype, to an incremental release schedule.

- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.

Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language, and are still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack. Come help us make the right decisions!

Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.
P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!
