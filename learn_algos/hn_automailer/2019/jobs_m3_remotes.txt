Shortform | REMOTE | Full-stack Engineer | Full-time / Part-time | $120-200k
https://www.shortform.io/

Do you like reading non-fiction books? Do you find yourself forgetting what you read days later, and feeling like you never absorbed the book's lessons?

Shortform is a book summary product that aims to make ideas actionable. It differs from existing book summary products in 3 major ways:
1) an emphasis on applying the lessons from books, through interactive exercises
2) high-quality summaries, with in-depth chapter by chapter summaries
3) building a community of learners who support each other to apply the lessons from books
Company status: We're in early development. The product roadmap is clear and we're building our engineering team. Shortform is seed-funded by the founder, who has built multiple bootstrapped and profitable companies.

Technology: We haven't finalized the stack but are circulating around Angular/Vue.js/React on frontend, Django/Node.js/Rails on backend. You can help contribute to this decision.

About the role: Ideally you're fullstack on the web, and comfortable on both front-end and back-end. Experience building mobile apps is a plus. Position is remote (current team is in Boston and Chicago). Fulltime / parttime roles available. We're able to pay competitive market salaries (i.e. not decreased by equity).
Email hiring@shortform.io to get more details about the company, our product roadmap, and the role.

Inception/Co-Founders | Cambridge, MA | Full-time | On-site or Remote
Privacy-first Location Services

I'm building a founding team of engineers who are passionate about privacy. And about the potential to architect a mobile app and backend with massive scale and reach. I've co-founded two startups before (2nd one acquired), then took a few years out to study applied science at MIT. Now there's a product I'm insanely passionate about turning into another startup. Working with counsel, I filed two patent applications on a technology solution for getting the benefits of location sharing without reducing any user’s privacy or anonymity. And I've validated the growth model with two key channels who bring a critical mass of users. I have funding: offer of convertible note funding from a friendly VC, and the ability to self-fund this through MVP.
The key roles I'm pulling together are UI/UX, front-end (Swift/iOS first), back end (large data/map optimization), but mostly I'm looking for strong technical generalists who are also excited about building a startup with a culture that loves learning, technical problem solving, and is located walking distance from MIT. Depending on the founding team, we may explore becoming a remote-first company. christian-hn@curatedinnovation.org

Grain | Backend Engineers | San Mateo, CA | Flex Onsite/Remote | Fulltime | https://www.grain.co
Grain is on a mission to make important team conversations accessible and useful for everyone, even if you weren't in the meeting. We do this by creating a replacement to Google docs that syncs perfectly with your calendar and video conferencing tools so that everyone is on the same page, with a perfect record of what is important but without the busy work. Think of it like TiVo for your team and customer video conference calls.

The team is currently 5, all engineering and one designer. We are looking for backend engineers to work in Elixir/Phoenix (previous experience in BEAM languages preferred but not required). We have an office in San Mateo where we work together at least two days a week but are highly flexible outside of those core working days. We are "stealth"(or whatever that means) but have raised seed funding and are currently selling our first customers. We have not yet "gone to market", so if you're looking to make a big impact and have lots of autonomy/responsibility, then it could be a great fit.

Co-founded by two brothers Mike Adams (co-founder of MissionU & Degreed) and Jake Adams (first employee at Branch), we're assembling a world class team to create a culture shifting software platform to encourage openness, transparency and efficiency.
If you'd like more information, please check out https://www.grain.co/careers or email jake [at] grain.co directly. Thanks!

Kami | Auckland, New Zealand | ONSITE | Full-Stack or Frontend Engineers | Full-time
We’re helping over a million teachers and students eliminate printing and scanning and the associated costs and effort - so our teachers can spend more of their time on achieving better learning outcomes for the next generation.
At Kami, we don’t believe in keeping our engineers locked in the backroom implementing specs sheets - you’ll be talking to the teachers who already love our product, and figuring out how to make Kami work even better in their classrooms. This position will suit an Engineer with a good product sense and is comfortable working relatively autonomously.

We're constantly pushing the boundaries of what you can do in the browser - I just spent the past week tracking down Chrome bugs on the new stylus-enabled Chromebooks! Our frontend is a SPA built in angular, and we have a Rails API/Postgres/GKE/JRuby backend that it talks to.

Most of our users are based in the US, and there may be occasional travel to attend conferences and visit schools using our software, which is a lot of fun! ( See the wrapup from our last conference in Chicago, IL: https://blog.kamihq.com/iste-2018-wrap-up/ )

Our office is in Central Auckland, New Zealand (with great public transport connections), and this position is local, though I will also consider remote candidates :)

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parser generators, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Load Impact | https://loadimpact.com/ | Python/Backend Software Engineer | Stockholm, Sweden | FULLTIME | ONSITE or REMOTE
Load Impact is the world’s most widely used online load testing service, with over 100,000 users from 190+ countries and over a million executed load tests - Google “web load test"!

We are a small company but very experienced in developing applications for performance testing and monitoring. We started out as a software development consulting company way back in 2000, developing performance test and measurement software for customers such as Nasdaq and the European space agency. We wrote both hardcore, low-level networking software and high-level web user interfaces and became quite good at both of those things. We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is. In 2009 we took the step and launched loadimpact.com, becoming a product company rather than a consulting company, and we have never looked back.

Recruiting is ongoing. We will respond to your application immediately. If you don’t have a CV ready, don’t create one, send us a link to your Github/LinkedIn with a few sentences about yourself.

We’re a small, fully remote and self-funded company that helps sales teams connect with prospects faster over the phone. Our customers use our product daily (~10,000 calls/day) and give us regular feedback.

We validate before we build, work on our own schedule, and execute on a focused vision.

This role is ideal if you like to work across the stack, routing calls through our event-based SIP softswitch, displaying real-time call information in our UI over WebSockets, or processing streaming audio for speech recognition. We use TypeScript/Node.js, Ruby, React, and Postgres.

What we’d love to see:


  - At least 2 years of full-time engineering experience
  - Past work that shows you’re comfortable with both back-end and front-end
  - You like working closely with product and sales to drive customer success
  - You’re not afraid to say “I don’t know,” but that doesn’t stop you from learning

Portchain | Copenhagen, Denmark | Full time | REMOTE | Front-end Software Engineer
We're hiring one front-end developer (NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, PostgreSQL) to join our team of 5 remote developers (incl. the engineering manager onsite in Copenhagen).

Experience working remotely. Minimum 4 years of professional software engineering experience.

90% of all goods are transported in containers. The largest container vessels can take on 20,000 containers at a time. The industry is struggling like never before, and is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, most communication is conducted through phone and even fax, paper is still used in abundance, there can be over 15 process handovers moving a container, and there are large regional differences in performance among players.

We want to change that, and bring the industry into the digital age. Portchain (www.portchain.com) is a Danish startup founded by 3 McKinsey alums in February 2017 that aims to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity for all players while providing industry leading customer experience.

We have paying customers and starting to get traction through pilot projects, therefore looking for 1 new member to join our team.

We are one of the oldest YC startups (YC ’06), operating one of the largest Ruby on Rails sites.

We are hiring software engineers across the board, including recommendations, search, payments, and core platform.

For engineering managers we are looking for someone who is experienced in leading, coaching and mentoring a software development team that delivers stable, high-quality software.

OpsLevel | Software Engineer | Toronto, Canada | Onsite | Full-time | https://www.opslevel.com
~About us~

OpsLevel is a very early stage startup based in Toronto, ON.  We're an experienced team of ex-PagerDuty, ex-Amazon, and ex-Shopify.  We have paying customers and just closed our seed round with fantastic Silicon Valley investors.

We want to make the Internet better by helping companies build more reliable software.  We're building a product to bring the site reliability best practices from companies like Netflix and Google to everyone else.

Our users' experience is paramount, so we relentlessly focus on all aspects of UX, from our UI to our APIs.  As developers, we also take great care with code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

Work/life balance is a priority for us.  We have family, friends, and hobbies that we want to attend to at the end of the day (and we suspect you do too).  Elon Musk can keep his 100 hour weeks.  We're happy to grow fast at 40 hours per week.

~About you~

You'll be one of our initial hires and working closely with our CEO, CTO, and other senior employees.

Your day to day will be writing software, but you'll ultimately touch many aspects of the business: talking to customers, defining new features, and then actually implementing those features end to end.  We don't have a lot of process or structure, so you should be good at working independently and getting stuff done.

On the technical side, we care most that you have an insatiable curiosity around technology and software.  You care about improving your craft and can demonstrate how you've done so.

~Stack:~

- Vue.js - Frontend

- Ruby/Rails - Backend / API

- Currently on Heroku (migrating to Terraform, Docker, and AWS)
More info: Email john@opslevel.com.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I'm the founder of this company, and a developer myself. 10 Months ago, I left South Africa to move to Singapore. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone in our Cape Town office would be remote from my perspective, I decided that the company needed to focus on hiring for remote. It's been a good experience so far!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. You can read more about us here: https://www.simplepay.co.za/about

We've been profitable for many years and have never had the need to raise capital. You'll be building on a stable platform, with a strong team.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)

Salary: $30k - $60k
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Coveo | Solution Developer - Implementation | Montreal & Quebec City, Canada | Full-time, ONSITE
You'll implement search based applications that change the digital experience for our customers and their customers. We warn you: it will be no simple task… Coveo has game-changing features out-of-the-box, but you will need great business acumen and technical skills to configure it perfectly to our customer’s environment. We are not talking about the color of the UI here: indexing, in the cloud, millions of documents in hundreds of different systems and deliver search results that are relevant to the user’s situation in less than a second brings its own particular challenges. You'll be making use of JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C# and ASP.NET and are comfortable working on both Windows and Linux.

While we offer all the perks people come to expect of a job (great new offices, top of the line equipment, competitive salaries and insurance, unlimited cappucinos and snacks, nerf gun battles), we think the best part about working with us is simply being excited about going to work every day. On a day to day basis you'll continually face interesting challenges, have great autonomy and you'll be able to bring your ideas to the table knowing that your team genuinely wants to hear them.

Coveo is positioned as the top leader for Insight Engines in Gartner's 2017 Magic Quadrant (http://blog.coveo.com/coveo-leads-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-insight-engines/). We're growing quickly and hiring talented, passionate developers to join our worldclass team. Our Montreal offices are brand new (http://blog.coveo.com/coveo-montreal-finally-home/) and we've also rebuilt our entire Quebec City office to accomodate all our new hires in a great environment.

Interview Process: phone screen - interview - tech test - offer.

Adacado | Senior Developer | Vancouver, BC, Canada | ONSITE | Full-timeYou have over 5 years of coding and web application expertise in a senior role, and want to do more innovative development and MUCH less mundane operations support.
“Creating Change is what we do.”
Adacado is looking for expert programmers to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically.   You’re the type of developer that is never satisfied. You strive to create new technologies/design patterns, and/or completely abandoning current systems and undertaking complete re-builds, using all the latest technology.  You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.

“Fail often, fail fast.”

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges.  Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, Node and ES6, and utilizes Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch.  We manage an ever growing army of microservices (100+) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

As a Senior Developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise.  You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis.  You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’.  You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill.  You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues.

The Adacado Team

Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit.  We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.

We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and  stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget.   All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit.  Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks.  We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.

To apply, send us an email: careers@adacado.com  Please indicate that you're applying from Hackernews.
