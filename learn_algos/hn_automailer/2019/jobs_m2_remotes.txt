Onzin Incorporated - San Francisco, California, USA [REMOTE]
Greetings! We are a small business in the US looking to hire a backend or DevOps engineer to work remotely with our team full or part time. The team is several engineers already, and you would be joining them in supporting our ongoing internal and external projects by helping to set up and provision backend systems and services, as well as some light application programming like API servers.

Our work is a combination of in-house projects with external client engagements filling in the gaps. For this role we would be looking for deep experience with back-end and infrastructure technologies like Amazon AWS or Google GCP, provisioning tools like Ansible / Puppet / Salt, Python development, shell scripting, Linux system administration, docker and containerization technologies, build and deploy servers, CloudFormation and Terraform for infrastructure management, as well as some basic networking skills. There will also be tasks involving setting up backend components like databases, job queues, and micro-services.

This is a great role for mid or senior level engineers who are looking for flexibility and some independence in how their work gets completed. Do note that while we are excited to be growing our business and adding a new position this year, we will likely remain a small team for the foreseeable future. We are also not a traditional ‘product’ company, and most of our time is spent on smaller applications and projects that eventually reach completion.
If you would like to know more, send a message to hiring@onzininc.com with your questions. To apply, please send a resume and few remarks about your background and technical experience to the same address. Thank you for reading, and good luck out there!

Indigo Agriculture | Senior GraphQL API Engineer, Senior React Engineer | Boston, MA | ONSITE | Full-time |
Our mission is to improve farmer profitability while pulling chemicals out of our food supply and making healthier food in the process.  You can read about Indigo's mission here: https://www.indigoag.com/about

More specifically for these roles: my team is building a Marketplace (https://www.indigoag.com/indigo-marketplace) where farmers can sell their crops direct to buyers without having to go through a middle-man, who historically takes a good part of the profits and disincentivizes the farmer from producing high-quality, sustainable crops since they all get mixed together.  In Indigo's Marketplace, farmers that product premium crops (Non-gmo, Organic, low toxins) get a premium price.  We're essentially building a market like the Nasdaq, but with many more dimensions (different crops, quality, selling windows), with heavy geographic components (buyers and sellers need to be close) and a bunch of different pricing options (hedging, futures, etc...), so there is no shortage of fun, complex problems to solve.

We use React, TypeScript and Apollo (GraphQL) on the front end and Node, TypeScript and GraphQL on the back end.  The combination of TypeScript on both the front and back ends and GraphQL in the middle allows us to be type-safe from the DB all the way to the web page where the data is bound.  We're been GraphQL since day one and are huge fans.

Please reach out to me directly at dcaddigan@indigoag.com or apply directly via the links below.  If you apply directly, write a note saying you're coming from Hacker News.

* Senior GraphQL API Engineer - https://boards.greenhouse.io/indigo/jobs/659135

* Senior React Engineer - https://boards.greenhouse.io/indigo/jobs/666210
