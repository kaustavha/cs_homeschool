Intel (Quartus FPGA compiler) | Toronto, ON, Canada
Interested in working on algorithmically-complex C++ code to squeeze out every last bit of performance? Actually using advanced computer science knowledge outside of interviews and programming competitions? Optimizing graph-based algorithms simultaneously for runtime, memory, and quality of the resulting solution? Understanding the hardware as well as the software? Then working on Quartus, Intel's compiler for FPGAs, is for you.

You will work in a downtown Toronto location, with an amazing and diverse group of talented engineers, on some of the most intellectually challenging problems in the world, and your work will directly benefit areas like AI, telecommunications, healthcare, aerospace, finance and more.

I am looking to hire specifically for the Timing Analysis team, which is responsible for one of the most critical components in the Quartus compilation flow (all compilation decisions are ultimately aimed at making the resulting FPGA design faster, and to determine the impact of various decisions on speed you need a robust and efficient timing engine). My colleagues are hiring for other roles. Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents preferred.
Please feel free to ask any questions here in comments, or send a resume to evgeny dot osovetsky at my company name dot com.

PathAI is looking for full-stack engineers and engineering managers to work toward detecting diseases like cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, and we hope developers at any point in their career who have great software engineering chops and potential can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.

Eleos Technologies | Remote (US only) | Full time
Eleos Technologies is a growing 8-year-old company building communication software for truck drivers and field workers.

We’re helping a diverse mix of customers—from mom and pop operations to household names—improve how they communicate with their employees by tackling information overload, reducing phone calls, and eliminating obsolete technologies.

We're looking to grow our mobile team, which maintains our native iOS and Android apps. These apps are used by thousands of big-rig and small truck drivers, day and night, every day. We've got two mobile engineers who have experience with both platforms, and we're looking to keep that flexibility and mindset as we grow.

The apps do some unique things, including assisting drivers to plan their trips, find stopovers, manage their electronic duty log, and more—there's a lot more than just CRUD and chat features to go around.

As a remote team, we're super lucky to have some great folks who use the ability to work from home to spend more time with their kids, help volunteer at a school, or otherwise be more fulfilled than they would be working from an office. You could join us!
If that sounds fun and rewarding to you, the full description and info about applying are over here: https://jobs.lever.co/eleostech/e09301bb-0e4e-4ccd-8d5f-e185f7ebd541

Moonfish (https://moonfish.com) | San Francisco, CA | Full-time, Onsite Preferred, but Open to Remote
Moonfish is a big data for consumer travel company, aiming to help people plan and book travel more easily and cheaply (starting with flights). While other travel products start by asking departure/return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).

We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA/Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.

- The API, built using Django Rest Framework (DRF) that is used both by our web-app and client libraries to build and run data analyses;

- Front-end is built on react, typescript, and apollo.
 - Data science uses python, and jupyter.  Must be able to code.
 - Backend is kotlin, graphql, k8s.Limited to mid/senior level candidates because we're entirely distributed.  We just don't feel like we can adequately support remote, junior candidates at this stage of the company.

Stacker | FULL-TIME | REMOTE ONLY (limited to Europe!) .
We're on a mission to let anyone create software, by building a platform to let you build apps without code.

We want to change the way software is built. That's a pretty big task, and we've got some exciting problems:

.

If you're a PRODUCT-FOCUSED ENGINEER, come and talk to us about how we're building a platform that lets us run rich, flexible apps built without fully code.

You'll be creating a React-based app editor that lets users create software through their browser.

You'll be building a Python-based backend that can connect to any data source, and simulate running complex data processes.

You'll taking ideas from programming language design and turning them into flexible functionality that can be used by non-programmers.

You'll be shipping new modules daily, which are used immediately by our users to make their apps work better and do more.

.

If you're a MULTI-SKILLED PRODUCT DESIGNER (UI+UX+Product), come and help us design a modular product that empowers non-developers to build the software they need.

You'll be creating a flexible design system that we can be customized by the user and still look great.

You'll be taking common web features like news feed and messaging, and stripping them down to their most pure form so they work in any app.

You'll be designing a set of modules that let non-technical users feel empowered and able to create amazing, innovative apps.

.

We're recently funded, and are a fully remote team, but we get together every few months.

We believe in Radical Transparency, being Empathetic and Kind and Making a Dent in the Universe.
Apply at https://stacker.app/hiring . Again, hiring within Europe, and as always, no recruiters ;)

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).
