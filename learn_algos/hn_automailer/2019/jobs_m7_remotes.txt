FullStory | Software Engineering, SRE, & Product | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA

FullStory | Software Engineering, Mobile Frameworks | Remote and Onsite | Atlanta, GA

FullStory’s mission is to improve user experiences on the web and mobile devices. We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.

Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording & Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search & Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.

We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture. If things like Rust, app and framework disassembly, or reverse engineering sound like fun, we’d love to talk to talk.

FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work. If that sounds good to you, join us!

Messari | New York, NY (NYC) | Onsite or Remote
We surface actionable info about blockchains via an API (time series, current, and real time via WebSockets) and a React web app. This currently includes market data, on-chain data, and qualitative information (Twitter, Github)... but we want to expand into a lot more (layer 2 networks, non-crypto, and metrics that are a function of other metrics)

example: how long does it take for a new version of a bitcoin client to propagate through the network? (implication: knowing how frequently members of a network update their client software reveals how quickly the network can adapt to new features or security fixes)

Stack: Kubernetes, Postgres, InfluxDB, Golang, Node.js, React/Typescript

Looking for people who are skeptical about crypto, have good OPSEC, and like to learn new things.

For backend people, we care about clean and performant APIs. You can choose to focus on on-chain data, ingestion infrastructure, or jump around across the backend.

For frontend/React people, we care about lightweight JavaScript payloads, fast renders, and minimal CPU usage (great client experience).

Starsky Robotics (YC S16) | Software, Sr. Software, Internships, All Robotics Positions, ML | San Francisco, CA | Onsite, INTERNS, VISA | Full-time
Come build self driving trucks! Starsky Robotics is a fantastic place to work, we're solving hard problems across the board and need help. We have positions open for all sides of the robotics stack, and are specifically looking for more Software eng. maturity for the platform and infrastructure teams. I personally work on the Infra side and am looking for extra hands on our data, simulator, and fleet management infrastructure. Interns welcome to apply as well!

Earlier this year we drove our truck with no one in the vehicle on a public highway in Florida, see video [1].

We recently opened new Software positions across all Truck systems.

Blurb:

We're working to make trucks autonomous on the highway and remote controlled by experienced remote drivers for the first and last mile. Our self driving trucks will make roads safer while giving drivers meaningful work close to their homes and families.

We currently run our trucks autonomously on the highway, with freight. We are looking for awesome engineers who are comfortable working on a scrappy, driven engineering team.

We use Python, C++, and lots of bash scripting. We are a group of PhDs, masters, bachelors, college dropouts, and high school interns all working together. No matter your experience, we're looking for intelligent folks who have a history of diving excitedly into new fields. We can sponsor visas. All positions non-remote unless otherwise specified.

Apply online, every application is read: https://jobs.lever.co/starskyrobotics/ or email me (daniel + @<company_name>.com) with any questions, but do not send me your resume (please apply instead online).

Joyent | Software Engineer | Remote, San Francisco, Vancouver, BC | https://www.joyent.com/about/careers/software-engineer-triton-object-storage-sf
The Product

The Triton Object Store, informally referred to as “Manta”, is a large-scale open-source object storage platform that is run across multiple geographical regions worldwide as a cloud service. Unlike other object storage products, it has strong consistency guarantees, it uses a Unix-like file system hierarchy for organizing objects, it supports containerized compute jobs on the storage nodes, and it supports multiple object links. Manta is run both as a public and private cloud service and on premises in many data centers. Architecturally, it is a large-scale distributed system composed of multiple microservices implemented in node.js and C with metadata state stored in PostgreSQL clusters. Additionally, we are exploring emerging languages and platforms for new development; e.g., Rust.

Candidates
We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code—software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.

Kalepa | Software Engineers | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.

Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.

Current Stack: AWS Amplify, React + Redux, Lambda (Node), Postgres, ElasticSearch

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in alot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”

Namebase | SF and REMOTE | Full-time | https://namebase.io
Namebase is a domain registrar and onramp for the Handshake blockchain.
Handshake is an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS. It's a protocol that's similar to Bitcoin, except that instead of using the coins for money, you use Handshake coins to register names on the Handshake blockchain. Handshake names are top-level domain names (.com, .io,. org, etc), and they're different from normal domain names because they're unstoppable; no one can censor, tamper with, or seize your name from you. Furthermore, Handshake names are associated with public keys, which enables SSL without relying on Certificate Authorities (a failure point in the security of DNS today).

Namebase is a domain registrar and exchange for Handshake (we're a separate company from the Handshake Foundation). You can register and manage Handshake names on our website, and if you don't have any coins, you can buy some using dollars or bitcoin on our exchange.

We're looking for a generalist marketer to run content marketing, community events, influencer marketing, SEO, and various growth experiments. If you have experience in developer relations that's a big plus!
Our mission at Namebase is to give an unstoppable name to everyone on the internet. Handshake makes it possible to have DNS that can't be shut down — even the Great Firewall of China can't censor Handshake names. We have the opportunity to change how the internet works, and our team is small enough that you'll have immense impact on our software development and company direction. Importantly, we don't have to do this alone. Our community is incredibly engaged and willing to help out, much more so than a traditional startup because we're working on a movement rather than a product. Message tieshun @ our domain if you're interested in leading this movement to build an unstoppable internet!

ago [-]

Location: BC, Canada
Remote Only

Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL, JS/Typescript, Rails, PHP, SQL, Many CSS preprocessors, AWS, Heroku

I'm a competent C and C++ programmer. The C++ spec weighs a lot, so I'm hesitant to call myself an expert, but I have a good working knowledge of the languages. For a previous employer I worked on a commercial Windows IDE for ~3 years.

I've been working on the foundations of a 3D game engine for ~3 years, which has taught me a great deal about C, systems and graphics programming on both Win32 and Linux. I chose to build it without libraries (Handmade Hero style) which began as a learning exercise, but ended up teaching me to value simplicity much more than I expected.

I can configure and maintain webservers, proxies and load balancers having worked with the web for 10 years.

I have a good understanding of the Linux network stack and APIs at the systems level - I've worked on several custom TCP + UDP protocols in the past.

I love building tools. Sometimes I feel like I was made to build tools. I build all kinds of tools - tools for computers, tools for automotive maintenance, tools for making tools. I've been building a game engine, which I would consider a collection of tools, for years and I still enjoy working on it.

Lastly, and I think this is interrelated with the tools thing, I'm a systems programmer at heart. I love having direct access to the chip and needing to understand the hardware architecture, as opposed to the internals of an interpreter, to write well-working and well-performing code.

That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase "Have strong opinions, weakly held".

I enjoy backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing, hiking, biking and beer! I live in a small town called Nelson in British Columbia, Canada and would strongly prefer to work remotely. I've been working remotely for several years for companies in the SF bay area and love it!
If you think I could be a good fit for your team and would like to chat I can be contacted by email at jesse.hughes.it@gmail.com
                      
                  
      


FreightFlows | Data/backend Engineer. Also Sales/Marketing and Product roles | Boston, MA USA | ONSITE or REMOTE
We're a new startup from Boston focused on the $20 Trillion dollar global seaborne trade market.

FreightFlows provides aggregated, predictive analytics for global trade. While maritime data continues to grow in volume and complexity, actionable insights continue to be elusive. The industry instead deals with inaccurate, stale and biased data from many fragmented sources. The complexity of bringing together trusted, timely information means companies have had to rely on dubious, incomplete market insight and therefore make decisions on anecdotal evidence. FreightFlows uses proprietary data science algorithms to synthesize data into trade truth, predictive analytics and actionable intelligence for traders, shippers, owners and brokers.

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers.

You would be working on the core engine and the surrounding components that make up our application.

What we are looking for:

- Strong CS fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, networking)

- Prior experience building software systems (network game, game engine, Web browser, database engine, etc.)

Experience in any of the following is a plus:

- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Database design and implementation (query planning, database/storage engines)

- Logic programming / optimization

Language experience:

- C++ is required

- Typescript / Javascript / Lua are plus.

- Any logic/constraint language, such as Prolog, Datalog, SAT / SMT, is a plus

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

ZeeWise | Atlanta/North GA | Software Developer | https://zeewise.com/ | USA REMOTE | Full-Time
ZeeWise is a very small software company that provides data aggregation and reporting for the franchise sector. We've actually been around for over a decade and have some very well-known customers despite our modest employee count. I'm one of the original tech founders and just took over as CEO. We're beginning the process of overhauling our product/tech stack.

We are looking to hire Software Developer(s) to tweak/update/transform our somewhat legacy platform into a more refined and scalable product.

Our stack is .NET and MSSQL with Angular (moving to Vue) on the frontend, however we're essentially rethinking everything so convince us why we should switch to your favorite stack instead of optimizing what we have.

Our platform has a lot of moving parts and though we are open to junior developers we're too small to be a training grounds/stepping stone position where you'll be compartmentalized to one tiny aspect of the product and playing ping-pong most of the day. We're ideally looking for senior/experienced devs (dare I say "full-stack") that are excited and confident about making systems architecture decisions that will have immediate real-world implications for tens of thousands of small businesses around the world. If you're junior but are confident in your abilities this might be an incredible opportunity and definitely don't be afraid to reach out.

We realize it is a very competitive market out there and are definitely prepared to pay competitive salaries for the right people no matter what level you're at (junior/mid/senior $80k-$150k+) and we're also prepared to negotiate ownership stakes/substantial stock options. As mentioned we're a small team and all have a very healthy work/life balance and a relaxed but productive work ethic.
If you made it this far and are still interested contact us at hackernews@zeewise.com

Mozilla | Operations Engineer | Remote
The team I'm on at Mozilla is preparing to hire more junior/mid and senior engineers in the USA, Canada, and Germany.

We build and maintain the infrastructure that supports Firefox’s many features. This encompasses around 70 services, ranging in scale from 2 users to 20 million concurrent connections, which are created by about a dozen different developer teams. Python is the most common language, though Nodejs, Go, Rust, and even Perl are also represented. When you take a look at the source of these services (most are publicly available in https://github.com/mozilla-services/ and https://github.com/mozilla/), you’ll notice that all are dockerized following the standards at https://github.com/mozilla-services/dockerflow.

Each service run by our team has a primary ops engineer as the main point of contact and a secondary to assist with engineering and on-call responsibilities, so no one person has to be familiar with every technology used in every service. Most services require on-call using pagerduty, but we regard pages as indicators of process problems and invest in the root cause analysis necessary changes to prevent failures from recurring. Although our top priority is keeping everything working well, you’ll often have the flexibility to balance your workload with services aligned with your skills and interests.

We standardize our infrastructure code across projects, so that your work in adding a feature to your own services’ infrastructure can easily be reused by the rest of the team. In our infrastructure Git repos, you’ll design, maintain, improve, and review automation, Python scripts, and monitoring code.
I'm told the postings should go live August 6th at https://careers.mozilla.org/listings/ . If you have any questions, contact me at bpitts+whoshiring@mozilla.com

Tierra (tierra.co) | Software Engineer | San Francisco/Mexico City | Onsite/Remote | Full-time
Imagine having all your day-to-day decisions dictated by a simple question – “Am I putting myself in danger? ” And then not having any real way to answer that question. Countries like Mexico are experiencing an unprecedented wave of crime and violence.

Both the financial and human cost are real:

• 530 billion USD get spent in LATAM on safety and security; 9.4% of Mexico’s GDP

• ~6% of gross revenues for companies is spent on safety/crime prevention

• 8 people go missing per day in Mexico

• 40% of people have changed their habits due to safety concerns

At Tierra, we are working to empower those who are most at risk with the data to make their day-to-day lives safer. We are a team of previously successful entrepreneurs (Twitter, Google, Stripe) based in San Francisco working closely with both governments and corporations in Latin America to pool data and make it actionable.

We work with very large data sets that drive us to constantly improve our technical skills (ever tried to render 1 million data points on a Google map and suggest safe routes?)

We strongly believe (and have begun to prove) that it’s possible to make a real difference by applying technology to a problem that affects hundreds of millions of people on a daily basis. All of us feel a sense of urgency and passion to make the world a little safer.

Want to come join and make a difference? Get in touch: jobs@tierra.co

Full stack engineering position. Our current stack includes Node, Python 3, AWS, Docker, PostgresSQL, PostGIS, GraphQL, React and React Native, Auth0, Jest, Google Maps, various deployment and migration tools, and more. It’s fun, it’s modern, and we’re still forming our business so we’re open to change – which you can help lead. You can help choose approaches in how we store data, access it, what technologies to use, how they should be implemented, how clients behave, and lots more.
Distributed – some of us spend time together in SF/Mexico City on a flexible basis.
Market compensation (both equity and cash). We are well funded.
Female-led. Truly diverse and inclusive team.

Narrative I/O | Scala Backend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | http://narrative.io/
Narrative is building the first global data marketplace.  It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.

- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.

- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.

- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.

We are hiring for the backend role and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.

ReadCoor | Hardware Software Engineer and Pipeline Software Engineer | Cambridge, MA | ONSITE, REMOTE | https://www.readcoor.com
ReadCoor is a company developing a platform for DNA sequencing in 3D tissue. We are a multidisciplinary team of biologists, chemists, hardware and software engineers building this technology to assist in the next leap of biological research and discovery.
Why 3D Spatial Sequencing?

Current state of the art DNA sequencing will tell you what raw "source code" you have. Various RNA sequencing technologies and recent single cell techniques will give you "runtime configuration" information. These techniques will tell you what molecules are present in a tissue, but they do not tell you where the molecules are located.

Our sequencing technology maps their location in exquisite detail. We can, for example tell you not just that a virus’s DNA was found in a sample, but also allow you to view the intact tissue and see which individual cells were infected. We apply this technology to all areas of biomedical research including infectious disease, neuroscience, and cancer biology.

Pipeline Software Engineer

Our backend pipeline engineering role is responsible for building and scaling out our ingestion and processing pipeline.

This pipeline uses a lot of python (numpy, scipy, skimage, pandas, dask, zarr to name a few libraries) to process individual tissue samples which range in size from 1-5 TB of images (and growing).

UI Developer

Our UI Developers are responsible for creating our web-facing data visualizations and statistical tooling as well as working with the hardware engineers and biologists to create cutting edge sequencing interfaces.

Our UI team uses JS, focusing primarily on React/Redux and Typescript.

Bioinformatics Developer

Our Bioinformatic Developers are responsible for interfacing with our biologists, primer design, and creating bioinformatic pipelines and analyses to support our three-dimensional spatial sequencing.

Our bioinfomatic team uses python and a suite of AWS services to facilitate

If you are not a Software Engineer, we're also hiring all sorts of scientists!

Hack Club (https://hackclub.com) | Director of Club Operations | San Francisco, CA or REMOTE
Launched 3 years ago, Hack Club is a nonprofit global network of student-led hacker clubs across 35 states and 17 countries, impacting thousands of students each year. Our programs span hundreds of after-school clubs, dozens of student-led hackathons, a vibrant online Slack community with thousands of students, and a fiscal sponsorship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship) program that recently crossed $700K in transactions and frontpaged Hacker News a few months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241).

We’re looking to bring in a Director of Club Operations to systematize and grow our primary program: clubs. You will own the end-to-end club experience, including processes to deliver high-quality mentorship to hundreds of club leaders worldwide, enabling Hack Club to scale beyond the number of calls our team can take in a week. If successful, this position will bring Hack Club from 2% of US high schools to becoming as ubiquitous and culturally foundational as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.

This role has C-level freedom, as well as responsibility. You will be tasked with solving the most challenging problems Hack Club faces as a rapidly growing student network. You must be able to work creatively and autonomously to design life-changing student experiences that you can simultaneously maintain and deliver to an ever-growing number of students.

Some examples of challenges to overcome:

- How do we build a diverse and representative community of student leaders and enable leaders to do the same within their clubs?

- How do we offer consistent value to students regardless of their financial background, making the club experience as powerful in Zimbabwe as it is in Cincinnati?

- How do we provide high-quality mentorship and coaching to a large body of student leaders, and bring students into the process of onboarding other clubs?

- How do we ensure that clubs survive the graduation of their leaders?

We need an obsessive, product-minded, operationally-excellent person with past experience growing direct-service programs and an intense focus on the student experience.
Interested? Email me at zach@hackclub.com with a detailed overview of why you think you’d be a good fit for this role.
                      
                  
      


Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (all levels) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

We're the fastest growing unicorn you've never heard of [0] and was just recently named CNBCs Most Disruptive Business beating out Airbnb, Stripe, Flexport, and more [3].

Indigo is revolutionizing agtech by offering better crops to farmers through technology. Agtech is one of the most underhyped technology trends [1] and we're serving a multi-trillion dollar marketplace services industry [2].

Our group is working on the Uber for Agriculture. We're developing a Transportation network to connect farmers with preferred carriers (trucks) to help them ship millions of bushels of grain across the United States. It's like a real world Traveling Salesman Problem with even more requirements.

We're growing so fast that I have to hire another 10 engineers just for my group in 2019. Back-end, front-end, mobile... you name it, we need the help (see all of them here: https://www.indigoag.com/join-us ).

Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.

Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.

No one says "not my job", and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)

On-site or US Remote: https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Engineering&gh_src=b44d958b1#openings

--

Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.

Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Fort Belvoir, Quantico, Washington D.C., or Reston:

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.

These roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support. We're currently looking for folks in a number of US cities as well as Belgium, Canada, DACH region (Germany, Austria Switzerland), France, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Adacado | Front End Developers and Back End Engineers | Full Time | Vancouver, BC, Canada | On-site | https://www.adacado.com/new-careers-page-2019/
Adacado is looking for experienced Javascript and Golang programmers to enrich our development skill pool and help take our application to the next level, innovatively and technically.  You’re not just a coder but have a passion for building things and watching them flourish.  You tinker and enjoy creating new methodologies, and never balk at completely abandoning systems and code to undertake complete re-builds. You're not about using the latest and the greatest but the right tools.

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its road map) creates many interesting technical challenges we have yet to solve.  Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, and ES6, and utilizes Node, Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch.  We manage an ever growing army of microservices (200+ unique across 300+ deployments) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise.  You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis.  You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’.  You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill.  You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues.
The Adacado Team
Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit.  We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource (see our link).
We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and  stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget.   All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit.  Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks.  We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.
Location
This is role will be based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be fully elligible to work in Canada. Remote applicants WILL NOT be considered.To apply, send us an email: careers@adacado.com

Magic | Full Remote Job | Full-time | Full-stack | Software Engineering
ABOUT THE COMPANY:

Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.

ABOUT THE POSITION:

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

ABOUT WORKING REMOTE:

This position is full remote and you can live wherever you want, or travel while you work with us. As our team is distributed across several time zones, compatibility with both UTC-7/8 and UTC+8 is helpful and willingness to participate in team meetings at non-standard times for 5-10 hours per week is ideal.

Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.

Bonus points if you've got...
- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins
- Experience within early-stage startups, remote, or human operations companiesApply here: https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hnr

TalkJS (https://talkjs.com) | Eindhoven (the Netherlands) or REMOTE (European timezones only)
TalkJS lets developers build custom chat features in hours instead of months. We're product driven and we power communication inside online marketplaces, community sites, trading platforms and so on.

JUNIOR PROGRAMMER WHO CAN WRITE

We're looking for someone who's great at writing, pretty good at coding, and wants to get better at the latter. We can give you an opportunity to deeply learn many technologies in a very brief time all while producing useful community content (tutorials, code examples, SDKs, etc) for our (potential) customers.

---

MOBILE DEVELOPER WHO LOVES API DESIGN

TalkJS is currently focused on the web and that's just not good enough. Easy to use APIs and SDKs are the key to our success on the web, and we're looking to do this natively on mobile as well. We could use your help with that.

If you're an experienced developer who's good at coming up with Java and Swift APIs that Android/iOS devs love to use, then get in touch. Apply by emailing to hey@talkjs.com. Bonus points if you can show us an API you designed (on any platform).

---

ONLINE MARKETER

Demand for TalkJS is quickly increasing to the point that we have no time left to work on the funnel that drives this demand. This is a luxury problem, which we intend to solve with full force with the help of you, an experienced online marketer with a passion for technical products. We're looking for someone who:


    * Has demonstrable experience growing B2B SaaS inbound 
    * Has sufficient tech skills to set up analytics pipelines 
    * Proactively iterates and experiments 
    * Can write 
    * Wants to jump on a rocket ship that's just taking off² 

Bonus points if you can code a bit. We offer you an opportunity to start, build, and lead our marketing team as we grow. Significant equity is on the table, as well as the chance to work in a great collaborative, open, and constructive distributed team culture.
Apply by sending an email to hey@talkjs.com. Mention something you've helped grow and include something you've written. This can be anything that shows your ability to enthuse: a blog post or a landing page or even a flyer for the local christmas fair.

²) I'm well aware that this is a platitude, but in our case it's really quite true and it wasn't half a year ago. We're blowing up and we need your help :-)

All jobs are remote (Europe) or on-site in Eindhoven, NL. No recruiters or agencies, please.
