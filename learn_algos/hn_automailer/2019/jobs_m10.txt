Intel (Quartus FPGA compiler) | Toronto, ON, Canada
Interested in working on algorithmically-complex C++ code to squeeze out every last bit of performance? Actually using advanced computer science knowledge outside of interviews and programming competitions? Optimizing graph-based algorithms simultaneously for runtime, memory, and quality of the resulting solution? Understanding the hardware as well as the software? Then working on Quartus, Intel's compiler for FPGAs, is for you.

You will work in a downtown Toronto location, with an amazing and diverse group of talented engineers, on some of the most intellectually challenging problems in the world, and your work will directly benefit areas like AI, telecommunications, healthcare, aerospace, finance and more.

I am looking to hire specifically for the Timing Analysis team, which is responsible for one of the most critical components in the Quartus compilation flow (all compilation decisions are ultimately aimed at making the resulting FPGA design faster, and to determine the impact of various decisions on speed you need a robust and efficient timing engine). My colleagues are hiring for other roles. Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents preferred.
Please feel free to ask any questions here in comments, or send a resume to evgeny dot osovetsky at my company name dot com.

Tact.AI | Bangalore, India & Sunnyvale, CA | Full-time | Onsite
At Tact (https://tact.ai), we're building the next generation of AI-driven enterprise sales SAAS. Tact.AI is the world’s first mobile sales productivity suite. Our device-native, conversational platform is used by Fortune 500 companies to transform the daily sales experience in the field and maximize the value of their CRM investments. Tact.AI brings together state of the art conversational AI built on a platform with a razor sharp focus on scalability and extensibility, tied together by a UX-first approach.

The India Centre of Tact.AI (which I’m an early engineer at) was set up in July 2018, with a focus on bringing together engineering talent to take Tact.AI to the next level, in terms of features, capabilities and scale, while building up on the culture of inclusion that we have always prided itself upon.

We’re always on the lookout for great engineers (at the moment we're actively looking for NLP/AI Engineers, iOS Engineers and Backend/Platform Engineers, while passively talking to engineers interested in what we're building who may not fit these roles directly) as we scale up the India centre, but same roles are also welcome in Sunnyvale. We had quite a bit of success with the Who's Hiring in the past, so here we go again!

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.

We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.

Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.

We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.

Lumicks | C++ Developers | Amsterdam, NL | FULL-TIME, ONSITE, VISA | lumicks.com
Lumicks is bringing novel tools for single-molecule biophysics and cell avidity to market, enabling scientific researchers across biology and medicine to unlock new types of experiments.

Our primary technology, C-Trap, can be used to "grab" a single molecule, and apply precise mechanical forces to it. At the same time, one can visualize the molecule using highly-sensitive fluorescence microscopy. Our customers use it to watch DNA being copied by the molecular machinery of the cell, or observe molecular "engines" walking across the scaffolding structures of a human cell. Lumicks systems are currently in use in opinion-leading labs across the globe, including Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Tsinghua University, NIH, Max Planck Institute, TU Delft, and Imperial College London.

We also produce z-Movi, the only instrument that can directly measure the overall strength of interaction between cells ("avidity"). This new technology, based on acoustic waves, could have an enormous impact on research in immunology, paving the way for new therapies for cancer.

We're an academic spin-off from a research group at VU University Amsterdam. We care deeply about providing our users with easy-to-use, reliable software that actively supports Open Data and Reproducible Science. To make this happen, we're looking to expand our software engineering team with additional:

C++ developers -- https://lumicks.com/vacancies/c-software-developer/

Our technology stack (familiarity with all of these is not required): C++17 (soon 20) for the core code, Qt5 for the UI and Python 3 for bindings. CMake builds everything. Libraries we use include abseil, asio, caf (c++ actor framework), catch2, cereal, fmt, hdf5/highfive, opencv, ranges-v3 and spdlog. Our GUIs are a mix of Qt widgets and QML (we are migrating torwards the latter). Our Python bindings are implemented using pybind11. On the hardware side, we have lasers. Lots and lots of lasers.

Levels | Frontend, Mobile, Backend developer; Data Science / ML | Remote, San Francisco, New York | Full-time
Levels is a funded, early stage startup working on making a dent in the metabolic crisis. Poor metabolic health is a risk factor for many diseases, and few people have the right tools to create positive feedback cycles with their diet and exercise. Based on our early Beta pilot, we're seeing people meaningfully change health habits, and are looking for people to help build our product out.

We're currently hiring for two roles:

* Full stack engineer. Our stack is currently React / Node / TypeScript + JavaScript / React Native. You'll help us build our direct-to-consumer buy flow, mobile app that processes biometric data from a sensor, and data display site.

* Data scientist / ML engineer. We have a lot of biometric data, and want to help people make sense of it with clear recommendations, anomaly detection, etc.

We're a remote-first team (with people in New York, SF Bay Area, Pennsylvania, and Portland currently), and—while we're excited to build our product—value a good quality of life and balance. Previously, folks in our team led startups, worked at SpaceX/Google, and had medical practices.
If any of this is interesting, even if your background doesn't line up exactly with the roles above, please reach out. I'm happy to share more information about what we're doing and we'll see if there's a good fit. Email me (Andrew) at jobs@levelshealth.com and mention HN.

Secfi is a VC-backed fintech start-up that helps start-ups and employees better manage equity compensation. We do this by providing shareholders of private companies with liquidity so that they can exercise their options or access capital for personal use. We build technology products that help private company employees make the most of their equity and make more informed decisions. By simplifying their equity compensation, employees can spend more time on things they love doing most. We have offices in Amsterdam and San Francisco.

For example: one of the most complicated things for employees is figuring out how much taxes they need to pay when exercising their Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options. The tax planning tool inside our dashboard does just that: https://www.secfi.com/#gif-container
An exciting challenge we’re working on next is an exercise planning tool that tells you what you should do with your equity based on your personal.
Things have been going very well here at Secfi, and we’re looking to add 10 more people to our Amsterdam engineering team in 2019.

Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).

We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA/Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.

Seeq (https://seeq.com) | Full Stack Engineer, Backend Engineer, Support Engineer | 100% Remote
Seeq makes data analytics software for a big market that’s often overlooked by tech companies: industrial process data. Think pharmaceutical manufacturers, wind farms, and energy companies with tons of equipment and sensors. Our software engineers tackle hard problems in streaming calculation, storage and distributed computing, leveraging the latest features in Java 11, Kotlin, and PostgreSQL.

Our company is 100% remote and proud of it. You can work anywhere in the US or Europe, but we require an overlap of 8am-noon Pacific working hours. We use a variety of collaboration tools, like Zoom and Slack, which makes us feel like we’re in the same building together. We have a stacked team of kind-hearted, talented engineers that love to collaborate, teach each other new tricks, and build products that far exceed our customers’ expectations.

Our technology stack is largely Java and Kotlin on the backend and TypeScript, AngularJS, and React on the frontend. The core of our product is a full-featured calculation engine that can perform complex math and execute machine learning algorithms on streaming time series data.

I am not the hiring manager, but involved with many parts of the interviewing processing, and happy to answer any questions. Feel free to contact me with questions at stephen.rosenthal@seeq.com (but please do not email applications to me).

PathAI | Boston, MA or Austin, TX | https://pathai.com | Onsite / Remote (US)
PathAI is looking for front- and back-end engineers and engineering managers to work toward detecting diseases like cancer faster and more accurately while paving the way toward personalized medicine.

We're working with a modern stack using Python/Django/Flask/DRF, alongside a Vue-powered front-end. Services are containerized, and we do our best to have a great engineering environment alongside our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're a technology company working within healthcare, not a healthcare company trying to leverage technology. I wrote about what this means to us: https://twitter.com/mjacksonw/status/1090693541565734914

We're growing quickly, so we're especially excited to bring on tech leads, but early- and mid-career developers who have great software engineering chops can find a great home here as well. You'll just want to make sure you have solid skills in python/django (on the back-end), vue/react (on front), or similar to be a decent fit.

Work alongside a diverse set of expert technologists, computational biologists, and computer vision scientists – if you're intellectually curious, it's an amazing environment to be in. We're well-funded with strong revenue, growth, and – most importantly – impact.

Armor Games | Part-time/Freelance Front-End Web Developer | Irvine, CA | ONSITE or REMOTE
Armor Games is a online community for casual gamers. We offer an online destination hosting over a thousand flash and HTML5 games with new titles launching every week. We also develop and publish game titles for mobile, desktop and console.

We are in need of a part-time/freelance front-end web developer who can dedicate 1-2 days a week toward evolving and improving the armorgames.com site.

The site is currently built on a monolithic LAMP stack with server-side templating and jQuery. We would like to start building out new front-end features using a modern front-end framework (like React or Vue) to improve both the look and functionality of the site. This will not be a wholesale rewrite of the site - we need to seamlessly rebuild small sections (ie, components) and integrate them into the legacy site. Knowledge of both modern frameworks and more traditional ("legacy") stacks is required.

Good Pair Days | Front-end of Full-Stack Engineers | Remote | Full-time
We get it. You’re in high demand. You’re a talented coder with options galore. The money’s good and the work's pretty good. So life’s good. We understand.

But we also know there's a few of you with itchy fingers.

A rare few of you who want the challenge to build something unique. To work on a challenge where the outcome is uncertain and your skills will play a direct role in determining which way it goes. A select few of you who are yearning for the thrill of pressing that button and launching your latest work into production without the layers of bureaucracy. Those of you who want to test their metal, and if proven, will be rewarded for getting on the ground floor.

It's our mission at Good Pair Days to disrupt a powerful and entrenched industry and liberate the world of wine from the aloof, the exclusive, the confusing, and the pretentious. To open up the joy of wine discovery for the novices through to the aficionados, by reimagining what the wine retail experience can be for one of the oldest consumer products on earth.

To give you an idea, one of our first products is something we like to call "Spotify for Wine". We like to think of it as providing monthly wine adventures, customised to each member's unique tastes, delivered to their door. Where they can learn as much (or as little) about their wines each month as they like. We're a little over two years old, and we've just started to hit our stride.

We're looking primarily for a front-end developer to join a small team of experienced full-stack engineers, but we're flexible if you also would like to move to the back-end.
BE Stack: Python/Django, GraphQL.
FE Stack: React, React Native.Feel free to contact me directly at beto at our domain name.

Seantis GmbH | Full-Stack Software Engineer | Lucerne, Switzerland | ONSITE Swiss or EU member-states passport-holders ONLY
We are a small Python shop in the heart of Switzerland. We mainly develop for governmental, NGO, medical, and pharmaceutical clients. We are not a web-agency however. We generally write applications that solve interesting problems and we avoid one-off code.

We have no regular meetings, are family friendly, and try to let people do their work as much as possible. We also control our full stack by developing both front- and backend. Additionally, we configure our own server stack using Puppet and Suitable, our very own Ansible API for humans (https://suitable.readthedocs.io).

If you join us you would be working on OneGov Cloud, our set of open-source web-applications running with our own framework built on Morepath: https://github.com/onegov/onegov-cloud

You would also shape our Linux server infrastructure, with Puppet as configuration language and containers as payload. Don't worry if you don't know Puppet or have not yet worked with containers, you can learn these things on the job.

Also, we don’t do algorithm questions, work samples or any of that. If you’re passionate about your craft and your resumé indicates that you know things, then you’re good. Note that you should at least know basic German.

We have also recently moved into a new office right next to the train station in Lucerne. Unlike other shops we have multiple small offices - no open space!

Aircloak (https://aircloak.com) | REMOTE (UTC+2) +-2 | Full-time senior software engineer
We are looking for a particular kind of person. This job ad might not be for you. May you find a job you are happy in either way!

You like to work independently, you are pragmatic, and you have the confidence to take on hard problems lacking a detailed spec. You value simple solutions over over-engineered ones. Chances are things will change down the line and changing something simple, or better yet something that was never made, is much easier than changing a monstrosity. You should not need or want anyone breathing down your neck to be productive.

With the formalities out of the way, let me introduce myself: my name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a remote company that has built a privacy preserving data processing and analytics engine. Think of it as an SQL database proxy that generates actually anonymized results on the fly.

There are countless challenging things to do in this job. They range from parsing SQL, to doing extensive query rewriting and optimization, to ensuring that all results produced are safe and fully anonymous irrespective of the level of deviousness on the part of the analyst using the system.

The skills we are looking for in a candidate are:


  - Intelligence and ability to deal with hard trade-offs
  - Great communication skills
  - The ability to work independently and take ownership of tasks
  - A desire to learn and improve

The majority of our system is written in Elixir, but we have parts written in Rust and JavaScript as well. You’ll even find some opportunities to write F# if you want that. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus and experience with web development is not going to hurt either.
We do not specifically look for someone with experience in our particular stack. It is our experience that people who are smart tend to pick up the required tools very quickly. Likewise it is less interesting to us what your background is. At the end of the day it’s your skills, brains, and experience that matter.

Our team is exceptional and quite geographically diverse. The company was built as a remote-first company from the beginning, and we really enjoy the benefits this gives us.

We look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to our team!
If you are interested, please write us at jobs [at] aircloak.com

We are one of the oldest YC startups (YC ’06), operating one of the largest Ruby on Rails sites.

We are hiring software engineers across the board, including recommendations, search, payments, Android & frontend-web. In particular we're looking for:

• Manager of Infrastructure Engineering

• Search Engineers

• Backend generalists for Content Engineering

In Amsterdam we are hiring backend software engineers with solid experience in building, running and scaling out cloud-native microservices (preferably in Ruby and/or Go). We value a hacker mindset, clean coding and a natural aversion to complexity (or if you're a glass-half-empty person: an affinity for simplicity).

Scribd has a very friendly, engineering-driven company culture with competitive salary and great benefits. We are ambitious but at the same time we value a good work life balance. In general we care way more about your personality and hacking skills than what languages you’ve used so far.

We have hired many people from these threads, including myself. If you have questions you can reach out to me directly at joe at scribd.com (I'm the Director of Application Engineering and happy to answer questions related to these roles - recruiters/agencies: please do not contact me).
Please apply directly via https://jobs.lever.co/scribd?lever-via=VzDSh9ZP1p

Unnamed Seed Stage Startup | Founding Engineer OR Founding Design/Product Role | Remote and Bay Area | Full Time
We are a new startup in the UX design tool space, with a mission to radically lower the barriers needed to build full-fidelity prototypes and products, and bridging the design-engineering gap. The stage is very early, pre-product, but we have enthusiastic early feedback.

The team of four has three ex-founders. We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.

We received strong funding offers from a number of top tier VCs. We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of esteemed angels/funds, including well-known leaders in the design community.

We're looking for two more individuals:

- Founding generalist engineer. No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.

- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.

In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.
If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com. Thanks, we're excited to hear from you!

Kalepa | Software Engineers | Machine Learning Engineers | Tech Lead | New York City, NY | ONSITE / PARTIAL REMOTE, VISA
Kalepa is a New York based, VC backed, startup building software to transform and disrupt the $1T commercial insurance market.
Engineers at Kalepa will be solving interesting and challenging problems at the intersection of big data pipelines, cutting-edge machine learning models, intuitive frontend apps, and robust infrastructure. You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.

One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.

Kalepa is led by a strong team with experiences from Facebook, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.

Portchain (container shipping startup) | Full-stack software engineer | Remote | Copenhagen, Denmark
Requirements:

5 years minimum of professional experience in Software Engineering. Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.

Our company:

Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions

Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.

We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.
Apply here: https://www.portchain.com/careers/611/full-stack-software-engineer/

Indigo Agriculture | Software engineers (3+ yrs experience) | Boston, MA | Full-time | On-site OR REMOTE | https://www.indigoag.com/join-us
================

I usually post this long thing about why we're a great company to work for and I realized that nothing compared to mission and purpose.

So yeah you can read our accolades and I'll reference them below, but the truth is nothing matters more than why we exist:

We're fighting climate change by building better apps for farmers and the agricultural economy.

If I didn't believe this was one of the most important problems of our generation to help future generations, I wouldn't put so much emphasis on this. If you want a mission you can tell your grandchildren about in hopes of creating a better environment for farmers (and really the whole world), we're working on it right here, right now.

I'd love to hear from you and learn more about how you can work with us. Our stack is JavaScript (React front end, Node back end).

For reference, we're a Unicorn company:

https://www.builtinboston.com/2017/09/26/agtech-startup-indi...

We work on the most underhyped sector in startups today (agtech):

http://stateofstartups.firstround.com/2018/#trends-and-takes

CNBC named us the Most Disruptive Company in the world, beating out Flexport, Airbnb, and other companies you've seen here on HN:

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/meet-the-2019-cnbc-disruptor...

And our big climate goal is to use regenerative agriculture to sequester 1 TRILLION tons of carbon from the atmosphere:

We're an early-stage company. All of us here at ChatLingual share the "big picture" view and make intentional, well-considered decisions based thereon. When we make a decision to do something, we acknowledge and document the ramifications of that decision, including the things we're _not_ doing. We design systems and write code that we'll be proud of, and when that's not the case, we acknowledge it, document the details, and prioritize fixes appropriately.

We've built a platform that allows people to communicate in 89 languages, which companies can use to support their customers around the world. We are looking for two experienced, broadly-skilled engineers to join our team as we grow: we are currently hiring for one senior position.

Stack is Node.js, Postgres, Redis, and Angular hosted on AWS using Terraform. We get to deal with problems like horizontally scaling WebSocket servers, data pipelining, balancing power and flexibility with ease of use, and a lot of other bits of engineering fun.

oso | Software Engineer | New York City (NYC) - Onsite | https://www.osohq.com/
oso (backed by Sequoia) makes backend infrastructure security not terrible for developers and ops. We provide a normalized and consistent interface to core security controls, like authentication and encryption, and we do so in a way that’s invisible to developers and simple for ops. To get from alpha to a production-ready v1, we are hiring small number of sharp engineers who want to get involved on the ground floor and who have some combination of experience in and appetite for taking on these kinds of problems:
1. Building an elegant experience for a highly technical end-user, e.g., making it easy and intuitive for an ops engineer to get up and running in <5 mins
2. Low-level distributed systems, e.g., building lightweight proxies that manage requests asynchronously and deal with things like caching and network failures
3. Running an on-path production service, e.g., building a scalable and resilient service layer across multiple regions and cloud providers
We are building the product in Rust, which we think is both a good design choice for our use case and a fun choice for the team. By virtue of our stage, the engineers who join now will not only have a disproportionately large impact on the product, but also on the culture and future of the company. Given the importance of these team members and magnitude of their contribution, they will get a meaningful equity position.

Founding team: Graham Neray (early employee and Chief of Staff at MongoDB) and Sam Scott (PhD in Cryptography).

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and a median house price of about $150,000.

Dynasty | Engineer | Los Angeles LA / Venice, CA | ONSITE
We're making AI for real estate. Our business is growing and we really need you to help expand our bot’s capabilities, consolidate, simplify, and scale.

We have six engineers, and we started in Summer 2017.

Our first product is Lisa, an agent that leases houses and apartments. Our clients now include some of the biggest companies in real estate.

People perceive a human leasing agent, texting from a nearby area code. Everyone who inquires gets a text back in a minute. If there's a question the bot can't answer, it goes to human fallback.

Lisa talks to thousands of leads an hour, and almost none ever ask "are you a bot". The hybrid AI (bot+human fallback) responds to most messages fully automatically, but still passes for human!

Speaking for myself, this is one of the most fun and technically challenging projects I’ve worked on.

We offer competitive salary and benefits.

Required: speed, pragmatism, a penchant for simplicity.

ML: Python, Tensorflow. Backend: Java. Frontend: React, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo.

(Experience with any of those is nice but not required. Tell us about your past projects and what motivates you!)
If you’re interested, please email me: dc@dynasty.com

Vathys | Vathys.ai | Lead Fabrication/Packaging Engineer | Full Time | Bay Area, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Mountain View | $120-250K plus equity
Vathys (YC W18) is building transformative machine learning hardware that  will redefine what is possible with machine learning.

We are building an integrated system- a new way of building a computer. Instead of having disparate chips and connecting them together with large wires, we build a single 3D and 2D scale-out system. In some ways it can be thought of as the "logical endgame of 2.5D/3.5D integration". Leveraging this new level of integration also required a radically new architecture and circuit design methodology.

We are hiring a lead fabrication/packaging engineer to implement the 3D integration flow.

Generous compensation will be provided to the right talent.
Please email tapabrata(underscore)ghosh(at)vathys(dot)ai if you're interested.

At Quill.org, we’ve created an online learning platform to help middle school students, primarily lower income ones, improve their reading and writing ability. Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.

Some info about Quill.org:

- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-p...

- We served over 1 million students last year and are continuing to grow.

- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts.

- We’ve been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (to name a few).

As a member of our engineering team, you will be directly involved in building tools for students, teachers, and administrators. We are looking for developers who can take features from a user story to production. We are a rapidly-growing team of 15 working in the Financial District of New York City. This is a full-time role on-site, and we cannot sponsor a visa at this time.
We're hiring: Junior, Mid-level, and Senior Full-Stack Engineers. Full positions here: https://www.quill.org/careers

We’re currently looking for a software engineer with reverse engineering skills to work with us on client-sided anti-cheat technology. Our current tech stack is mainly Go, MariaDB and React, but the project you would be working on is a standalone client built in C/C++, Go and Assembly.

Requirements:

* Good understanding of C and x86-64 assembly

* Good understanding of the x86 architecture

* Good understanding of the Windows NT kernel

* Good grasp of reverse engineering

Translation) (e.g. EPT, NPT)
* Understanding cryptography primitives
The role we’re looking to fill is full-time. You’ll be working together with another anti-cheat engineer to combat cheaters in video games. We can offer relocation to Sweden and assist with housing.

United Income from Capital One | FinTech Startup | Full Stack Engineer - Javascript | Onsite in Washington, DC | Full Time We’re hiring! United Income is a fintech startup looking to add engineering talent to our team.
We were recently acquired by Capital One and are operating as an independent subsidiary while having the backing of a Fortune 100 company!
Email us at engineering@unitedincome.com if this describes you.

• Do you care about delivering quality product to your users?

• Is providing maintainable, tested code to your fellow engineers (and future self) important to you?

• Do you have a deep understanding of Javascript and/or Python? Are you interested in the movement to a serverless infrastructure?

• When you encounter a problem that isn't neatly packaged and fully defined, are you passionate about digging into it and refining a solution?

If you can answer yes to these questions, you'll find working here exciting and engaging.

At United Income, we value collaboration. We encourage one another to build phenomenal things, and individually we’re all passionate about doing our best work. You'll be responsible for solving some hard problems in consumer finance. As you tackle these problems head on, you'll work with others across the company to make sure you have all the information you need.

Some of our engineering roles involve cool mathematical modeling. If you can engineer and you also have fun thinking about math, we have some opportunities for you that can be difficult to find in standard engineering jobs. We are committed to equal opportunity and diverse hiring. Even more important than hiring is supporting our diverse team, and we are dedicated to equitable pay and transparency.
As you know, this industry moves FAST. If you have 15 years of Node.js experience...well we think you’re lying ;) We don't expect you to be familiar with our entire tech stack (buzzwords: Javascript/Python/React/AWS/CI/CD/Git). What’s important is your willingness and ability to learn. We want to see your curiosity and passion for what’s out there.

We're used by companies like Trello to translate their help center (https://help.trello.com/), Tinder to translate their blog (https://blog.gotinder.com/), and RocketMiles to translate their web app (https://www.rocketmiles.com/) - to see our product in action, click any of those links and use the website's language switcher to switch from English to another language.

Localize works by providing a code snippet (similar to the Google Analytics javascript snippet) that our customers add to their website / web app. The Localize snippet pulls in content from the page into the Localize dashboard where our customers login to add translations and manage their content. Localize automatically deploys those translations to the customer's production site.

We're hiring a Product Designer to own & shape the customer experience. You'll oversee new functionality from early concept, to wireframe, to prototype/mockup, to pixel-perfect design and launch. Please get in touch if you're a seasoned product designer with extensive experience designing UI / UX for B2B SaaS products (design portfolio a must). To apply, please see our job posting below or email myself, brandon@localizejs.com, and say hello!

We are a team of ~10 people working fully remote. We are a profitable cashflow-positive company with over 500 customers worldwide. We offer competitive pay, a full benefits package, and a culture with an emphasis on work + life balance.

Knotel | multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://www.knotel.com
Knotel is a fast growing commercial real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 50 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years or more, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.

Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.

As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are building internal tools to increase our efficiency as a company. We are continuing to work on our data pipeline to ensure all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.

In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to solve.

We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.

Today we're hiring a whole bunch of roles:
- Full Stack Engineers https://grnh.se/a0d117a21
- Data Engineer https://grnh.se/951f098f1
- DevOps Engineers (job posting coming soon)
- Director of Engineering (job posting coming soon)Any questions, feel free to email me victor [at] knotel dot com

Zymergen | Emeryville, CA | Full-Time, Onsite | https://www.zymergen.com/
Zymergen uses biology as a source of new chemical building blocks that enable the development of novel products and materials. We have many open positions across engineering, science, and all other functions listed on our website: https://www.zymergen.com/careers/

My team is currently looking for a Senior Software Engineer. We write the software that translates experiments designed by our scientists into actions performed by robots and automated laboratory equipment. Combined with the work done by our colleagues who are geneticists, data scientists, research associates, and many other disciplines, our work leads to new chemicals with properties unlike anything that can be derived from petroleum.

Our tech stack is different from what you'd normally see in a factory or biotech laboratory. We call this role “Software Engineer” and not “Automation Engineer” on purpose: Our codebase currently contains REST APIs served by Django apps, Vue.js for user interfaces (and simple Django forms with sprinkles of jQuery for others), Python’s asyncio in worker processes, and a collection of device drivers (also written in Python). Our infrastructure includes Kubernetes, Puppet-managed EC2 nodes, Kafka, MySQL, as well as a few cherry-picked components you’d find in a traditional process control system (e.g. Windows machines, Programmable Logic Controllers). No prior experience with robotics or automation is required, we're happy to teach you about these things.

One specific area our team is trying to get better at is frontend development and we hope that you can play a role in that. Be prepared to become our resident frontend expert and to spend 50% or more of your time designing and implementing user interfaces. All our users are internal to Zymergen: They include scientists who need to tell the robots what to work on, support engineers who troubleshoot misbehaving robots, and manufacturing engineers who rely on utilization data from our dashboards.
The full job description is here: https://www.zymergen.com/positions/?gh_jid=1754529 Email me at jonas@zymergen.com about this job or to chat about software for factories!

newline (formerly Fullstack.io) | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.newline.co/write-a-book Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year. Our books sell very well because: - We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps. - We guarantee the books and code are up to date.
- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)
- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend, Fullstack D3 even more.)

We’re looking to write content about JavaScript, Building Full-stack web apps, Angular, React, ASP.NET Core, Serverless, Python, Elixir, Blazor, Data Science etc. Anything up and coming.

We’re a driven, energetic startup with a team of 250+ based in central London, Munich and Madrid. We’ve raised over £55+m in funding since we launched from top VCs and Daimler, so we’re growing fast. We’re relentlessly driven and constantly asking ourselves how we can make carwow better.

Smarkets | Full Time | ONSITE (London, UK; also Downtown LA, California)
We're a modern betting exchange, going technology first to enable proper price competition in a field of fat commissions. Join a small, agile, and fast-growing team, in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help setting up a brand new office too.

Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.

The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React & React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend and mobile, infrastructure, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.

If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at https://smarkets.com/careers .

---
ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.

Beacon Biosignals | Lead Front-End Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time
About us:

Despite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.

We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.

Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.

About you:

- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.

- You believe that "looks great" does not necessarily equal "feels great", and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).

- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.

- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between "DRY" as an important guiding principle of software development, and "DRY" as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.

- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.

- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.

- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.

Outside of the browser, our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. Our nascent tooling for serving data to the browser is written in Julia as well. We're still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack, however - come help us make the right decisions!

Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.
P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!

- You love building consumer products and seeing people say they love what you've built.

- You love learning (human) languages and serving people from diverse backgrounds.
To apply, please send a resume to ron (at) ai2-in-c-u-b-a-t-o-r.com (with dashes removed, that's "ai2 incubator" - scraping bots are getting fancy haha). Please add HN to the email subject.

On a day-to-day basis you’ll primarily be working with Ryan (https://twitter.com/rymohr) and will be involved throughout the entire development process: from the initial brainstorm to flush out the basic architecture all the way to the final stages of testing and release. We like to move fast and ship often, and we try to break work into weekly deliverables to keep everyone’s expectations and progress in check. We do a quick hangout at the beginning of each week to revisit everyone’s immediate priorities.

Once a year the whole team gets together for an adventure, with past retreats including snowboarding in Oregon, surfing in Hawaii and rock climbing in Colorado.

Please send an email to careers@kumu.io if you’re interested or know somebody we can reach out to who might be. Thanks!

[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers
Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]

Job positions:

- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)

- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.

- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.

- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.

- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of "Electron apps", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)

- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc

Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.

Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com

PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.
PS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).

The ideal applicant pays close attention to detail, is inquisitive, able to be self-directed while open to collaboration. We follow an unapologetic “no ego” release process where fellow engineers input opinions and suggestions on the code you would like to release to production, thereby attempting to ensure the highest quality code is released. You’ll be working on a team that owns the code from development through release into production, for multiple applications, deploying a DevOps model of complete ownership.

A bit more about the position: The position will involve support of several of our web applications. Foremost among these would be the customer dashboard. Our dashboard is setup to serve our different subsidiary companies with the same set of code. It is angular, with a dash of ionic (which we have been slowly moving away from while staying committed to angular.) The dashboard is actively developed with 11,000 commits over the last two years. As a developer on the membership/mobile team we are concentrating on improving our customers membership experience by adding and improving features to the dashboard. Other applications you will have the opportunity to interact with are a c#.net api application, a .net student course runner application as well as older .net internal applications.

We run in an agile pattern with two week sprints, story point estimating, daily zoom standups, and sprint retrospectives. Our sprint planning meetings typical have developers discussing what the highest priority is with direction from the product owner and divvying up the sprint work as the developers see fit. The position is 100% remote, with the occasional in person all engineering meetings which occur for a few days every year or two. We have typically had new developers on the team spend a sprint working on improving test coverage as it allows them to get into the code and understand the code base.

Harvard Library Innovation Lab | Web Developer | Cambridge, MA | Onsite, Full-time
The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is hiring a lead developer for opencasebook.org, our free, Creative-Commons-licensed legal textbook publishing platform.

About the project: opencasebook.org democratizes access to legal education by replacing $200 textbooks with free, forkable, digital or print-on-demand alternatives. We’re used in law classes at Harvard Law School and elsewhere; our website and code are open and available to anyone in the world. We’ve saved students over $1 million in textbook costs and have the potential for orders of magnitude more.

About the team: LIL is a group of ~10 developers/designers/lawyers/librarians building projects for systemic change, based out of the Harvard Law School Library. Our other projects include case.law, an open database of 360 years of precedential American caselaw; perma.cc, which fights link rot in court decisions and law review articles; and the Nuremberg Project, digitizing one of only two copies of the full evidence record from the WW2 Nuremberg trials. We’ve done side projects on distributed encryption, crowd-sourced fair use advice, interactive art installations, and more.

About you: this is a great fit for a more experienced developer (like me!) who is looking for a low-stress job with high social impact and great opportunities for personal growth. We use Django and Vue, so you should either have experience with those or with getting up to speed on new things. We are a very small team, so you should be prepared to contribute across the stack and to be very self-directed about what you work on day to day.

Personal opportunities: Another programmer here recently described this as the “most human” place she ever worked, and I feel the same way — we’re a small group from a lot of different backgrounds with wide scope to do creative work, so we place a lot of emphasis on making sure everyone has what they need while they’re working here. We each have real support to pursue experiments drawing on our own experience and enthusiasm, whether that’s exploring side projects, taking classes at Harvard, teaching classes at Harvard, making art projects, organizing conferences, advocacy, etc. Many of us have done more than one of these, and we’re serious about maintaining both a work/life balance and an exploration/exploitation balance within our work.

Job page with application link at the bottom: https://lil.law.harvard.edu/collaborate/2019/h2o-developer/

—
(This is a weird one! There aren't many programming jobs, even academic jobs, that pay a steady salary to creatively pursue social impact with a broad, self-directed scope like this. It's an awesome job for the right person -- please pass it along if you think you know that person!)

Squarespace | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Onsite |  New York City (West Village area)Apply here! 
https://www.squarespace.com/careers/jobs/77247
The Squarespace Machine Learning team is growing! We source projects from all over the company, ranging from direct integrations of NLP & computer vision into our products to behind-the-scenes services that improve efficiency in our customer help center. Our team prizes stakeholder-focused development of research and project deliverables while also taking time out for reading groups, conference attendance and Hack Week projects that pursue educational and research goals.

The ML team uses a Python-focused development stack with all the usual ML and data processing libraries. We have a framework for rapidly deploying our models behind lightweight Flask web applications in a managed Kubernetes environment and to thrive in our team you should enjoy the full range of backend engineering tasks that go along with this. You won't be developing ML models in isolation, but instead demonstrating leadership and ownership over deployment strategies, architecture choices to solve cold-start problems, defining observability and monitoring strategies and working with stakeholders to define validation metrics that don't merely represent statistical considerations like overfitting or precision & recall but go further to develop holistic understanding of model success in a broader product development context.

We are seeking a senior machine learning engineer with a highly developed skill set in software engineering, architectural design and experience mentoring junior engineers and collaborating with multiple stakeholders to deliver projects. You should be skilled in the application of machine learning both on the statistics side and the backend engineering side and comfortable moving between the two sets of responsibilities as the situation demands. We welcome applicants with experience in any variety of machine learning or applied statistics context (e.g. quant finance, time series analysis, audio processing, etc.), though the candidate should show an enthusiasm for information retrieval, search and recommendation, and computer vision models because these are at the forefront of what we do.

Squarespace offers highly competitive compensation and exceptional benefits & work life balance. In this role you can also expect a high degree of autonomy to help lead choices in ML technology investment and data set curation to set up Squarespace for future success. If this challenge sounds interesting to you, we'd love to hear from you so please apply! Feel free to use the cover letter space to let us know you found us via Hacker News!

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].
The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as "high risk". [4]

Fortune ranked us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5] [6].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, parental leave, fertility/adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We get everyone together 2-3 times a year, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.dauber@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/React/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.

Associate/Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, devops, or security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

Adacado | Front-End/UX Developer | Full-time onsite | Vancouver | https://www.adacado.com
You have over 4 years of web application design and coding expertise, and want to do more innovative front-end development in unorthodox ways.

Adacado is looking for expert front-end developers with proven coding and UX design skills. You have the perfect balance of left and right brain, with an eye for great dynamic industrial style and the mind to implement the complex logic to drive it. HTML/CSS/ES6 are second-nature to you, you are equally comfortable with CSS keyframes and HTML Canvas as well as Javascript asynchronous functions and DOM manipulation.

You are very adaptable, and know that there is no single way or right way to develop. You understand that the endsare more important than the means, and the endswill forever evolve and always introduce new challenges. You don’t hesitate to abandon code or methodology in favor of something new that better solves the current problem. You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.

Adacado client-side applications contain most of our business rules, and you will be expected to design, implement, and maintain complicated business logic as per our architecture. Your designs and code will be expected to effectively manage data efficacy, data versioning, and all calls to our various APIs.

As a developer at Adacado you will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new features in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis. You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of constant group learning as we exchange expertise and experience with each other. You have no problems spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill. You understand that the best tool for the job is teamwork.

The Adacado Platform

The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges. Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, and ES6, and utilizes Node, Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch. We manage an ever growing army of microservices (150+ unique across 300+ deployments) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.

The Adacado Team

Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit. We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.

We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours, and a generous skills-development/education budget. All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun!)

Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit. Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks. We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.

Location

This is role is based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be eligible to work in Canada. Remote applicants WILL NOT be considered.
